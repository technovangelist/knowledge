JWT. JSON Web Token. But it's usually pronounced as jot. if you hear someone talk about a jot, it might actually be a JSON Web Token. what is a json web token...i mean jot. It's simply a way to share some fact between services in a verifiable way. The actual RFC for jots says that it is a compact, url-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. A claim is any 'piece of information' about a subject.  And URL-Safe just means using any characters that are allowed in any URI. 

If you look around the web for information about JWT, you will find a lot of articles and videos that explain how to use them, along with a bunch like these that say they are terrible and no one should ever use them. The folks who say they are terrible, are mostly focused on one use-case, and one potential configuration in that use case.
