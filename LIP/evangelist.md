# What is an evangelist
Different folks have different definitions. And no two evangelists have the same role. At a super high level an evangelist for a technology company:
- Helps guide the potential customer to the top of the sales funnel with:
	- talks at conferences
	- videos
	- social media
- Works with existing customers to share their feedback with internal engineering teams
- Helps customers get the most out of the platform 

Many company's choose to give this role other titles due to the negative religious connotations of the term. Alternate titles for roles that do the same general thing include:
- Developer Advocate
- Developer Relations
- other names as silly as those two


I am currently an evangelist at [InfraHQ](LIP/What is Infra.md) and have held that title at [Datadog](LIP/Datadog.md), Placester, and Yottaa. And when I was an SE at Microsoft I worked closely with an evangelist there. I have had the domain Technovangelist for much longer though, first acquiring it in the early 1990's
