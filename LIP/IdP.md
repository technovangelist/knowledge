There are a number of common Identity Providers out there:
- [Okta](LIP/Okta.md) (www.okta.com)
- Auth0 (www.auth0.com), acquired by Okta. A tool I used for authentication for some learning platforms when I was at [Datadog](LIP/Datadog.md)
- OneLogin
- CyberArk
- Microsoft
- IBM
- Ping Identity
- SecureAuth
