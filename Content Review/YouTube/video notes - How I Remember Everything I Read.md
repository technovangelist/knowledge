Comment: ==level 7 means taking the source notes and creating permanent or evergreen notes. these are atomic and cover a specific topic. pull in lots of references from different places. Make the connections in what you read. notes that are about topics you find interesting. organized into a "slip box"== ^ytAjoxkxMI5g738c
