## Video Description on YouTube:
Fairwinds has created an open source project called Astro. Astro is a Kubernetes operator that watches objects in your cluster for defined patterns and manages Datadog monitors based on this state. Astro provides 3 key elements to greatly simplify monitor management:

- Automated management of the lifecycle of Datadog monitors for workloads running in Kubernetes: Given configuration parameters, the utility will automatically manage defined monitors for all relevant objects within the Kubernetes cluster. As objects change, monitors are updated to reflect that state.
- Correlation between logically bound objects: Astro has the ability to manage monitors for all objects within a given namespace. This ensures greater consistency across monitor configurations.
- Templating of values from Kubernetes objects into managed monitors: Any data from a managed Kubernetes object can be inserted into a managed monitor. This makes more informative alerts and can make monitors more context specific.

Fairwinds is the Kubernetes enablement company providing software and services to enable organizations to run secure, reliable and scalable Kubernetes infrastructure.
