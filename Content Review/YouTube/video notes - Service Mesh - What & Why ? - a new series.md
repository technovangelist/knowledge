Today I kickoff a new series about service mesh technology.
What is a service mesh and how it facilitates service to service communication
What are some of the pain points of scaling microservices, especially when dealing with retry logic, TLS, authentication, auto backoff, metrics and tracing.
We cover the concepts of how a service mesh addresses some of these issues.
And move to build a good use case to kick off the series.
In the following episodes, we'll use this as a foundation and look at Linkerd and Istio.
