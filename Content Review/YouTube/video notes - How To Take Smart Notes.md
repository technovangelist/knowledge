>Plenty of folks, myself included, will highlight a passage and think thats it. Theres even plenty of examples of that in this obsidian vault. but thats not going to make it stick. You have to process the thought. Use your own words. What resonates with you? Write it down. That is why writing is thinking, not the result of thinking. ^ytBG1tfC7tSYw171c
