>Carrier applied for a patent for his “Apparatus for Treating Air” in September of 1904. On the second day of 1906, the patent was granted. Before long, Carrier and a band of entrepreneurial engineers from Buffalo Forge broke off and formed the Carrier Engineering Corporation, devoted exclusively to the manufacture of air-conditioning systems. The business made Carrier a wealthy man, as air conditioning went from a curiosity to a luxury item to a middle-class necessity. In 2007, the Carrier Corporation, now part of United Technologies, did $15 billion in sales. ^rw35507406hl

>When Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot down in 1983 after drifting into Soviet airspace thanks to faulty, ground-based navigation beacons, Ronald Reagan declared that satellite-based navigation should be a “common good” open to civilian use. Around that time, the system took on its current name: Global Positioning System, or GPS. ^rw35507403hl

>Guier and Weiffenbach spent the afternoon hunched over the receiver, listening for Sputnik’s audio fingerprint. To combat the doubters, who would inevitably question whether the whole launch was an elaborate hoax, a product of communist propaganda, the Soviets had engineered Sputnik so that it would transmit an unusually accessible signal: an unbroken tone broadcast within 1 kHz of 20 MHz. By the end of the afternoon, Weiffenbach and Guier had a clear lock on it. The sound itself was a staccato pulse of electronic bleeps, but the context transformed it into the most marvelous music the two men had ever heard. It seemed unbelievable: sitting ^rw35507402hl

>For forty years, ecologists have used the term “keystone species” to designate an organism that has a disproportionate impact on its ecosystem—a carnivore, for instance, who is the only predator of another species that would otherwise overwhelm the habitat with unchecked population growth. Remove the keystone predator and the habitat falls apart. ^rw35507401hl

>As he put it in his diary, “Throughout the whole group of Islands, every single atom, even from the most minute particle to large fragments of rocks, bear [sic] the stamp of once having been subjected to the power of organic arrangement.” The vast majority of those particles and rocks were aragonite skeletons, the remains of a coral polyp that had died decades or centuries before. This alone was evidence that Lyell’s theory was flawed: if Darwin was standing at the tip of a dormant undersea volcano, the rocks at his feet would have been basalt or obsidian or pumice, rocks created from the cooling of molten lava. The rocks would have been forged in a fiery core of magma, not excreted by minuscule polyps. The fact that the soil of an Indian ^rw35507399hl

>April 12, 1836, HMS Beagle took leave of the Keeling Islands, after a two-week idyll that had given Darwin the crucial evidence he needed to support the first great idea of his young career. As the ship left the placid green waters of the lagoon, heading home to England via the island of Mauritius, Captain FitzRoy plumbed the depths on the periphery of the atoll with a line more than 7,000 feet long. He encountered no bottom. ^rw35507398hl

>The standard story about Snow is that he solved the mystery of cholera’s waterborne transmission by doing shoe-leather epidemiological detective work during the 1854 Soho outbreak, but the truth is he had built a convincing rendition of the waterborne theory well before 1854. One reason he was able to see around the biases of the reigning “miasma” theory of the day—which maintained that cholera was caused ^rw35507396hl
