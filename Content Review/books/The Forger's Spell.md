>Before Van Meegeren was unmasked, the critics looked at Emmaus and found themselves overwhelmed by its “serenity” and “calm” and “elevation” and “dignity.” Then came the astonishing news that the supposed masterpiece had nothing to do with Vermeer. The critical response turned 180 degrees, immediately. A Dutch art historian named Sandra Weerdenburg demonstrated the flip in irrefutable detail in her doctoral thesis. Weerdenburg found that the old critics didn’t change their minds, or at least didn’t say so. Almost without exception, they simply stole away in silence. But a new cast of critics appeared at once, and many of them singled out for scorn the very elements that had won praise only a few years before. What had been hailed as “serene” was now damned as “static,” what had been “dignified” had grown “lifeless,” what had been “tender” had become “sentimental.” ^rw35507292hl

>In 2002, for instance, a French wine researcher named Frédéric Brochet gave fifty-four experts an array of red wines to evaluate. Some of the glasses contained white wine that Brochet had doctored to look red by adding a tasteless, odorless additive. Not a single expert noticed the switch. Curiously, amateurs did better than experts. “About two or three percent of people detect the white wine flavor,” Brochet says, “but invariably they have little experience of wine culture. Connoisseurs tend to fail to do so. The more training they have, the more mistakes they make, because they are influenced by the color of the wine.” ^rw35507291hl

Perhaps a group of smart people who knew everything there was to know about the Dutch Golden Age, who believed as an article of faith that they could make flawless snap judgments, who knew that forgers could fool other people but could never fool them? ^rw35507290hl

>A painter who wants to involve viewers emotionally needs to leave us some work to do ourselves. Once having collaborated, we find ourselves hooked. Artists figured it out long ago. A painstaking, seemingly perfect depiction of reality has its charms, the art historian E. H. Gombrich explained, but a painting that contains less hard “information” may nonetheless seem more real and more compelling. The reason is the Uncanny Valley again. ^rw35507288hl

>People liked R2-D2 and C-3PO. No one cared that they looked as much like vacuum cleaners as like human beings. To be 50 percent humanlike was fine. “But when a robot becomes ninety-nine percent lifelike,” Thompson went on, “so close that it’s almost real, we focus on the missing one percent.” Something about the skin strikes us as wrong; the dead eyes make us cringe; the herky-jerky movements turn us off. The once-appealing robot suddenly looks like a mechanized zombie. “Our warm feelings, which had been rising the more vivid the robot became, abruptly plunge downward. Mori called this plunge ‘the Uncanny Valley,’ the paradoxical point at which a simulation of life becomes so good it’s bad.” ^rw35507287hl

The painting had suffered from grime and rough handling. It had not been deemed worthy of mention in the auction catalog, and its name, if it had ever had one, had been lost. Today we know it as The Girl with a Pearl Earring. ^rw35507282hl

>Weschler, too, had been communing with The Hague’s Vermeers. (The Girl with a Pearl Earring, A View of Delft, and Diana and Her Companions are at the Mauritshuis.) The judge’s remark, Weschler wrote, opened his eyes to “the true extent of Vermeer’s achievement—something I hadn’t fully grasped before. For, of course, when Vermeer was painting those images which for us have become the very emblem of peacefulness and serenity, all Europe was Bosnia (or had only just recently ceased to be): awash in incredibly vicious wars of religious persecution and proto-nationalist formation, wars of an at-that-time unprecedented violence and cruelty, replete with sieges and famines and massacres and mass rapes, unspeakable tortures and wholesale devastation.” ^rw35507280hl

Two centuries afterward, one well-regarded historian still seemed scarcely able to contemplate Philip’s grisly record. “If there are vices…from which he was exempt,” wrote John Lothrop Motley, “it is because it is not permitted by human nature to attain perfection even in evil.” ^rw35507278hl

>In Holland in 1943, for example, the Gestapo arrested a Jewish art dealer named Kurt Bachstitz. It so happened that Bachstitz was married to the sister of Goering’s art scout, Walter Hofer, and Hofer intervened on his brother-in-law’s behalf. “Bachstitz is to be left alone,” Goering commanded the Gestapo. On August 14, 1944, Goering’s private detective escorted Bachstitz safely to Switzerland. Goering collected his fee in paintings. ^rw35507274hl

>He did carry out a series of homemade experiments, but the goal was only to give his house paint the right feel for painting on canvas. “Here’s a Miró,” he says, pointing to a picture with faint stars in a pinkish sky. “That’s what happens when you mix a bit of washing-up liquid [dishwashing soap] in with the paint.” That hadn’t worked well enough to repeat. But Myatt found that a glob of vaseline taken straight from the jar and stirred into his paint worked wonders, and he used that technique again and again. It would have been an instant giveaway, fingerprints at the crime scene, but no buyer ever carried out a single test. ^rw35507273hl

You rescued the German people from darkest night and brought the Reich to the glowing light.” ^rw35507272hl
