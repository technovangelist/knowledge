>The problem with water in the Midwest and on the East Coast is that it is always falling at a different rate. After a spring deluge it is torrential; in a late summer drought it dribbles and drips its way downward. Curiously, this is less a problem in the West, where low-velocity, high-volume mountain streams run at a remarkably consistent rate as gradual snowpack melts meld into early-autumn rains. The Sierra Nevada was by its very nature a better place to install early hydropower, which ran in rivers and streams, than were Midwestern industry towns, because with every change in water’s velocity, the intensity of the power produced by the dynamo in early hydroelectric systems shifted as well. ^rw44024975hl

>In creating his grid, he took care to make each dedicated piece only interoperable with other Edison components. If you wanted his bulb, or his circuit, then you had to also buy his dynamo, his switches, and his lines. When something went awry, you had to hire Edison’s men to come fix it. ^rw44024974hl

>As a result the electricity we use, day in and day out, is always fresh. So fresh, that less than a minute ago, if you live in wind farm territory, that electricity was a fast-moving gust of air. And if you live in coal country, it was a blast of pulverized coal dust being blown into a “firebox”—a huge, industrial, flash-combusting furnace. If you live in hydro country it was a waiting rush of water dammed up by a massive concrete wall. Picture it. The electricity you are using right now was, about a second ago, a drop of water.

>America has the highest number of outage minutes of any developed nation—coming in at about six hours per year, not including blackouts caused by extreme weather or other “acts of God,” of which there were 679 between 2003 and 2012.

Not only do we have more outages than most other industrial countries, but ours are getting longer. ^rw43180220hl

>Literally speaking, our grid is comprised of the battery, its port, the charger, its plug, the outlet and its wall-hidden wires out to the street, the transformer and the familiar forest of urban utility poles, the low-voltage wires that run along these poles out to the substation, more transformers (bigger here), some syncrophasers, relays, switches, and fuses and the giant pylons that march away across the empty parts of America carrying high-voltage wires to the power plant, where it all begins in an electromagnetic generator spun fast by a steam-heated, or wind-blown, or water-wheeled, or gas-combusted turbine. Our grid is a peculiarly pervasive infrastructure that touches every life, pierces every wall, bifurcates every landscape, and runs every battery. ^rw43180217hl

>A couple of years ago I was shown a snapshot a friend had taken of a sunset, its dusky pinks and evening grays bisected straight through by power lines; it even had a couple of utility poles smack-dab in the middle of the frame. “Look,” she said, “what a beautiful sunset.” The grid was right there and it didn’t even disturb the view. It’s the world’s largest machine and the twentieth century’s greatest engineering achievement and we are remarkably oblivious to it. ^rw43180216hl

>Transitioning to sustainability is the big, long-term challenge. But left out of this picture is the fact that for the most part, America does not run on gas, oil, or coal any more than we may one day run on wind, solar, or tidal power. America runs on electricity. The age of information has remade the ways we communicate, socialize, and even learn things into electricity-dependent processes. And though we tend to think of this shift in terms of computerization, the computer is only the tool. Electricity is what makes it work. ^rw43180215hl
