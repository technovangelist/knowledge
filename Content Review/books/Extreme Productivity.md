>Before you start writing, create an outline that shows the logical progression of your piece. Start by brainstorming ideas; then put them into relevant categories, and finally organize them into a logical order. 2. Use the introduction of a piece to provide context, establish the theme of the piece, and indicate how it will be organized. 3. Create an executive summary for long or dense documents that describes the big picture so that readers short on time can understand the main points. 4. Start each paragraph with a topic sentence presenting its main idea. You want your reader to be able to read off the tops of the paragraphs if he or she is skimming. 5. Don’t use your conclusion to merely summarize the piece; provide the reader with additional insight, such as broader implications or suggestions for future actions. 6. Use effective language. This means short sentences, clear relationships between clauses, and proper use of antecedents for pronouns. 7. Proofread your paper for grammar and spelling mistakes. When you’ve finished, proofread again. One error is one too many. 8. Accept that your first draft won’t be perfect. Don’t try to write and revise at the same time, or you’ll get hung up on every sentence. 9. Use as many words as you need to cover your topic to your audience’s satisfaction, but don’t add length for length’s sake. 10. Don’t try to write a long piece in one sitting; write regularly every day for an hour or two in an environment that best suits you. ^rw35507089hl

>TAKEAWAYS 1. Don’t try to read more words per minute; increase your speed by reading fewer words—the ones most relevant to your goals. 2. Before you pick up a text, think carefully about why you are reading. Are you looking to learn the author’s general thesis? Are you looking for specific facts? 3. Have a clear rationale for reading a particular newspaper or other news source. What are you getting from this newspaper or source that you can’t get from others? 4. Look at the structure, especially headings, before you start to read. These will show how the piece is organized and give you an idea what topics will be covered. 5. Read the introduction in depth, looking for a thesis or theme sentence and a paragraph showing the organization of the piece. 6. Read the conclusion before you read the body. Often, the conclusion shows where the author is going and reviews the author’s main points. 7. Read the tops of body paragraphs. This will allow you to actively decide whether each paragraph is worth reading, in light of your reading purpose. 8. Don’t go further if the paragraph just repeats points that are already familiar to you, or if its content is not central to your purpose. 9. Focus constantly on finding what you want to remember from an article or memo. 10. If you are reading for the document’s main ideas, write a short summary of the ideas you want to remember when you finish the document. 11. If you are reading to evaluate the author’s analysis, write down each of the main steps in his or her argument. This will allow you to focus on these key steps as you delve further into the argument. ^rw35507088hl

>distill what you want to remember into a few key points relevant to your purpose for reading this particular piece. If you’re reading to learn specific facts or discover new sources, you should simply write down a list of those specific facts or new sources. If you’re reading to understand the key ideas, capture those ideas in the form of a short summary. ^rw35507087hl

>As you read an article or memo, constantly ask yourself what you want to remember from it. Although this is closely related to the earlier discussion of reading purposes, it has a different time dimension. Think about your purpose for reading before and during your review of the material. Think about what you want to remember during and after you review the material. ^rw35507086hl

>Skimming to evaluate the author’s analysis requires even more judgment. After reading the topic sentence, determine whether the rest of the paragraph will advance a new argument or merely parrot the conventional wisdom. If the paragraph challenges the commonly accepted worldview, read it closely, as such paragraphs often form the crux of the author’s argument. ^rw35507084hl

>To actively skim the body of an article or chapter, you should read the top of each paragraph. A good writer starts each paragraph with a topic sentence, followed by supporting facts or arguments. Once you’ve read the first sentence, you can decide whether it’s worth reading the rest of the paragraph. ^rw35507083hl

>If the introduction and conclusion have given you a good idea of the main points, you can safely skim the body of a piece. That’s because you have already narrowed your purpose in reading the body: to expand your understanding of the key points or clarify complex concepts. As a general rule, skimming allows you to zero in on what’s most important to you—and skip the rest. ^rw35507082hl

>List all the news sources, virtual and physical, that you read regularly for reasons other than amusement. Next to each source, jot down your rationale for reading it—politics, sports, business news, and so on. Next ask yourself how you’re reading each source: are you concentrating on your goal for that publication, or does your attention wander every time you see an entertaining headline? Now, next to each publication, jot down an estimate of how much time you spend each week reading it. Does your allocation of time make sense, given your professional Objectives? If not, read only those sections that are relevant to your purpose, or stop reading that publication altogether. ^rw35507076hl

>think hard at the start of a project about where it’s going: what are the critical issues, and how are they likely to be resolved? After a day or so of gathering relevant information, write down your tentative conclusions for the project. These will allow you to more quickly engage in analysis—rather than description—by providing a focus for your subsequent research. Write the conclusions in the form of a rebuttable hypothesis that can be revised as the project progresses. You might even have to scrap your conclusions completely as you learn new facts. That’s fine. This approach is similar to the scientific method: you generate a set of hypotheses; then you test them out, not the other way around. ^rw35507074hl

>I believe that you can maximize your productivity by applying three related ideas:          • Articulate your goals and rank them in order of priority. This helps you align your time allocations with your priorities.          • Focus on the final product. In tackling high-priority projects, quickly formulate tentative conclusions to guide your work.          • Don’t sweat the small stuff. Deal with low-priority items in a way that allows you to spend as little time on them as possible. ^rw35507070hl

>During most of the last five years, I’ve held two full-time jobs—serving as full-time chairman of MFS Investment Management and carrying a full teaching load at Harvard Business School. I’ve also served on the governing boards of two publicly traded companies (Medtronic and Nielsen), a health care foundation (the Commonwealth Fund), and a medical research center (the Harvard NeuroDiscovery Center). At the same time, I’ve managed to write three books (including this one) and publish roughly a hundred articles in newspapers and magazines. Through all this, I’ve maintained a strong relationship with my wife of thirty-five years and our two children, as well as a wide network of friends and relatives. ^rw35507067hl
