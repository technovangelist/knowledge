>Lauri, the householder, sits with us, fervid and garrulous
>He has moist, coal-black eyes. His ancient father and mother, his wife and five children come and go, or crouch round a rusty stove whose flue pokes through the ceiling. They are dressed almost in rags, ingrained with dirt, gaping at the elbow, shoulder, knee. The women walk on blackened feet the children too, their skin striped harsh where sandals have once been. Three of the girls are pretty, but already knots of worry are puckering between their eyes. ^rw148879535hl

>And so, in the West, it still seems. The most sacred of the world's mountains - holy to one fifth of the earth's peopleremains withdrawn on its plateau like a pious illusion. For years I had heard of it only as a figment. Isolated beyond the parapet of the central Himalaya, it permeated early Hindu scriptures as the mystic Mount Meru, whose origins go back to the dawn of Aryan time. In this incarnation it rotates like  a spindle at the axis of all creation, ascending immeasurable miles to the palace of Brahma, greatest and most remote of the gods, and plunging as deep beneath the earth. From its foot flow the four rivers that nourish the world, and everything created – trees, rocks, humans – finds its blueprint here. In time the mystical Meru and the earthly Kailas merged in people's minds. Early wanderers to the source of the four great Indian rivers- the Indus, the Ganges, the Sutlej and the Brahmaputra – found to their wonder that each one rose near a cardinal point of Kailas. ^rw148876607hl

Comment: Kailas and mercy is the mountain at the center of so much. The source of the big 4 rivers. Also home of god of death. Hindus believe the summit is the palace of shiva. ^rw148876607comment

>At one of these bottlenecks we find the rock daubed red with the Maoist rebel emblem a hammer-and-sickle circled beside a swastika (here an archaic symbol of good fortune) – but the guerrillas themselves have gone. For ten years they paralysed this region, and would politely leach for money the few foreigners who ventured in. They took over 13,000 Nepalese lives. But now, three years later, with Kathmandu's royal dynasty swept away, they are jostling for power with the decrepit politicians in the capital, and their old slogan – Follow the Maoist path!' - is flaking from cliffs and walls. ^rw148876273hl

Comment: Adding a rough date to the walk. Sarah dealt with the rebels many times, and visited with the royal family before being killed off  so I know that time ^rw148876273comment

>We reach a cairn stuck with weathered stakes, then descend through pines towards the river. Its noise rises to us in the hiss of far-down cataracts. Peacefully beneath us, and seaming the far banks in long yellow shelves, the terraces of an unseen village are ripening with corn. The slopes flame with the reds and purples of late spring, with shrubs I do not know. Giant walnut trees appear, and silvery aromatic  shrubs, while overhead the mountain peaks gather in jagged crenellations and seem to enclose the place in a private peace. ^rw148870090hl

Comment: Cairn: a mound of rough stones built as a memorial or landmark, typically on a hilltop or skyline.  I had no idea Nepal grew corn  and that it would be visibly yellow ^rw148870090comment
