>I’ve heard people object to the idea that rich countries should go first: “Why should we bear the brunt of this?” It’s not simply because we’ve caused most of the problem (although that’s true). It’s also because this is a huge economic opportunity: The countries that build great zero-carbon companies and industries will be the ones that lead the global economy in the coming decades. Rich countries are best suited to develop innovative climate solutions; they’re the ones with government funding, research universities, national labs, and start-up companies that draw talent from all over the world, so they’ll need to lead the way. Whoever makes big energy breakthroughs and shows they can work on a global scale, and be affordable, will find many willing customers in emerging economies. ^rw155546214hl

Meanwhile, Costco sells 8 liters of soda for $6, a price that amounts to $2.85 a gallon. ^rw156447472hl
