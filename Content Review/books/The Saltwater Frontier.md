>One crew member on the Mayflower mocked the passengers for their seasickness, taking great glee in telling “them that he hoped to help cast half of them overboard before they came to their journey’s end.” Plymouth’s governor, William Bradford, seemed to take some wry satisfaction in the sailor’s ironic fate, writing that “it pleased God . . . to smite this young man with a grievous disease, of which he died in a desperate manner, and so himself the first that was thrown overboard.” Bradford continued to be aghast at the conduct of seamen, like “the master, one Baker,” who arrived in 1624 to fish for cod but “proved a very drunken beast, and did nothing (in a manner) but drink and guzzle and consume away the time and his victuals, and most of his company followed his example.”7 ^rw35507332hl

>Still, Native women had some rights that were unknown to their colonial counterparts. As teenagers they enjoyed a period of sexual freedom before finding a husband, and married women were allowed to “leave their husbands frequently, upon grounds of displeasure or disaffection.” “If a woman ha[d] a bad husband” she could not only seek divorce but also move to a neighboring village, “where [women] never come unwelcome: for where are most women, there is greatest plenty.” The very act of planting served as a constant reminder of female economic power. ^rw35507330hl

>Part of this critique stemmed from the European notion that farming was men’s work, hunting was an aristocratic leisure activity, and therefore Native economies were dangerously backward if men allowed “their Wives [to be] the Husbandmen to till the Land.” However distorted the colonial gaze was, though, there is ample evidence that in Algonquian households men were dominant over women. ^rw35507328hl

>Farmers in the tropics of Central America had raised the nutritionally balanced trio of maize, beans, and squash as staples for some two thousand years. These crops, which some Indians called the three sisters, began to spread rapidly from Mexico and the Southwest into the eastern woodlands of North America with the onset of a climate shift that scientists call the Medieval Warm Period (900–1300 CE). ^rw35507326hl

>Indians who were furious at overreaching English authorities began a conflict in 1675 that would become the deadliest conflict ever fought on these shores. We know it as King Philip’s War, so-named after the Wampanoag sachem Metacom, whom the English called Philip, who acted as the symbolic head of the Indian campaign. Historians ^rw35507325hl

>The English and Dutch long feared the other would ally with coastal Indians to overwhelm their colonial competitors; their mutual suspicions would only heighten in the years before James, Duke of York, first seized New Netherland and renamed it in honor of himself. Sensing their neighbors’ shared fear of conspiracies, Native sachems would traffic in rumors to use the Europeans’ quarrels for their own gain. ^rw35507324hl

>The rivalry between England and the Netherlands started to overshadow frontier dealings throughout the region. It was soon apparent that the fates of all villages along the shore were tied to the outcomes of distant naval battles in the Caribbean and North Seas and of domestic upheavals in London and Amsterdam. And American events could have consequences in Europe, too. ^rw35507323hl

>Our sunny pictures of Europeans and Indians gathering by calm seas to swap goods or dine on turkey are not entirely wrong—these folks did sometimes trade and feast in peace. But an honest view of this shore’s past must also feature darker scenes of captive taking, shipboard stabbings, attempted piracy, intentional drownings, mass incinerations, and ritual dismemberments. ^rw35507321hl

>But even nuanced accounts can share the same blind spots as the legends. Too often we suppose that the story started when colonists left their ships. We forget that Indians met Europeans as fellow mariners. We allow colonists’ artificial borders to stand to this day, telling two unrelated English and Dutch stories. And we therefore assume that colonization was a process that happened only on soil.3 ^rw35507320hl
