>Of play, author Jack Uldrich writes, “It allows people to practice skills they might need later down the line. But play goes beyond such life skills. When we play, we gain practice manipulating things and controlling the outcome of events. We also devise new solutions for old problems and create new endings for our experiences.”12 ^rw138922169hl

Comment: Game days allow ops to practice and come up with new solutions before it’s critical ^rw138922169comment

>“Einstein was slow in learning how to speak …,” explains Einstein biographer Walter Isaacson. “He also had a cheeky rebelliousness toward authority.… But these traits helped make him a genius.
