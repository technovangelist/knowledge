>organizations (Pew Research, for one) Three Google Data Sources Google Trends allows you to see what others have been searching for over time, graph how often a term has been searched for via Google, and pinpoint where those searchers are located (www.google.com/trends). You can also browse searches by date or see the top searches in various categories via its Top Charts tab (www.google.com/trends/topcharts). Its Explore tab lets you see how a search term has trended over time and the direction it's trended in (www.google.com/trends/explore). Google's Ngram Viewer is more obscure, but it lets you search and graph words and phrases from a vast number of books that Google has scanned in public libraries to populate its Google Books search engine (https://books.google.com/ngrams). It's a useful (if quirky) tool for finding trends over a much longer time frame than measured in Internet time. Think with Google is geared toward marketers and is intended to be a one-stop research hub that aggregates case studies, articles, infographics, interviews, and other things for 14 industries (thinkwithgoogle.com). Its weekly updates make it a good place to poke around ^rw35507099hl

>Think before ink means finding your key point by asking three questions about every bit of content you're creating. We talked a lot about this process in Rule 6, but to recap: Why am I creating this? What's my objective? What is my key take on the subject or issue? What's my point of view? And, finally, the critical so what?-because exercise: why does it matter to the people you are trying to reach? ^rw35507097hl

>Reframe: put your reader into it. Reframe the idea to relate it to your readers. Why does it matter to them? What's in it for them? Why should they care? What's the clear lesson or message you want them to take away? What value do you offer them? What questions might they have? What advice or help can you provide? ^rw35507093hl
