>organizations (Pew Research, for one) Three Google Data Sources Google Trends allows you to see what others have been searching for over time, graph how often a term has been searched for via Google, and pinpoint where those searchers are located (www.google.com/trends). You can also browse searches by date or see the top searches in various categories via its Top Charts tab (www.google.com/trends/topcharts). Its Explore tab lets you see how a search term has trended over time and the direction it's trended in (www.google.com/trends/explore). Google's Ngram Viewer is more obscure, but it lets you search and graph words and phrases from a vast number of books that Google has scanned in public libraries to populate its Google Books search engine (https://books.google.com/ngrams). It's a useful (if quirky) tool for finding trends over a much longer time frame than measured in Internet time. Think with Google is geared toward marketers and is intended to be a one-stop research hub that aggregates case studies, articles, infographics, interviews, and other things for 14 industries (thinkwithgoogle.com). Its weekly updates make it a good place to poke around ^rw35507099hl

>Think before ink means finding your key point by asking three questions about every bit of content you're creating. We talked a lot about this process in Rule 6, but to recap: Why am I creating this? What's my objective? What is my key take on the subject or issue? What's my point of view? And, finally, the critical so what?-because exercise: why does it matter to the people you are trying to reach? ^rw35507097hl
