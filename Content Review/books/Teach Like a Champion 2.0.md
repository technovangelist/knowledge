>For most teachers, asking questions with precision and efficiency requires thinking of them in advance. Planning questions not only makes them more precise measures of what you taught but also frees you from having to think of your next question on the spot. You can move through questions more quickly, listen more closely to student responses, and, in turn, track patterns or trends in student mastery, perhaps even tabulating them. Planning your questions in advance also allows for more precise word choice, which leads directly to better, more revealing questions. In addition, once the lesson is over, having these questions scripted into your plan makes it much easier to reflect on and sharpen your questioning skills (Did they work the way I asked them?), an advantage that can steepen your learning curve over time. ^rw139811856hl

With something like this: Teacher: OK, so let's make sure we're clear on the differences between plant and animal cells. Jason, what does the presence of a cell wall tell me about the cell I'm looking at? . . . Good, and what else might tell me I was looking at a plant cell, Charlene? . . . And which cells have chloroplasts, Jose? . . . Yes, and why do they have them, Sasha? . . . Good; it sounds like we're ready to move on. ^rw139811854hl

>If technique 1 focuses on “rejecting” self-report, you might ask, “What do I embrace instead?” One of the simplest and most valuable answers to that is Targeted Questioning—a quick series of carefully chosen, open-ended questions directed at a strategic sample of the class and executed in a short time period, often a minute or less. ^rw139811853hl

>Finally, the way we often ask these questions—with a wait time of a fraction of a second; a willingness to accept silent assent without testing; a look of relief, even, when we get silent assent because we really just want the green light to move on—intimates very clearly that we're not expecting a response. Students know not to speak up. If they do, our response can also send the message that they weren't really supposed to answer. A ^rw139811852hl

>When you ask, “Do you understand the differences between the structures of plant and animal cells?” what your students may be assenting to is, for all practical purposes, “Can you think of something you know about the difference between plant and animal cells?” The vague nature of most self-report questions exacerbates this. If our questions aren't directive, they have no reason to draw students' attention to the many things they should know; this encourages them not only to give us false positives but, possibly, to believe them themselves. ^rw139811851hl

>Whether they're addressed to adults or kids, in a school, work, or athletic setting, questions like “Is everyone clear on . . .?” or “Everybody got it?” are functionally rhetorical—they're asked over and over, the answer is almost always a passive “yes,” and it is almost never accurate. ^rw139811850hl

>Volumes of social science literature have established that self-report is highly unreliable. Questions that ask for binary (that is, yes-no) answers are particularly suspect. Throw in group dynamics in the classroom, and for the great majority of self-report questions, what we get back isn't really even an answer so much as a formality. Whether people understand or not, they almost always say they do, particularly in groups. The result is that we get little if any data at a moment when our instincts are telling us we should be assessing. ^rw138922162hl
