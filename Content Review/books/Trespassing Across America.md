An amazing story of a walk from the beginning to the end of the proposed Pipeline XL. Although it started as a book to understand why anyone would want the pipeline, it quickly became a story about the generosity of the people living in proximity to the pipeline. Lots of stories about the people and the land and their relationship to each other.

>A pipeline is built to send a resource from a place that has a lot of it to a place that doesn't. But civilization won't collapse without new oil pipelines; it'll collapse without clean water, healthy soil, and a stable climate.

>For the stationary person, time moves slowly if it moves at all. The stationary person has a keen eye for the present. Time is measured by a period of years: the growth of children, the lifetime of a roof, the passing of parents. And he thinks he is at the end point of a long story that has led up to that moment and that there isn't anything to add, as things will forever exist as they currently are. But the hiker sees something else. He sees the glaciers shaping the land, the stars wheeling overhead, the buffalo trails replaced with asphalt roads, the grass replaced with corn, and he recognizes that this moment is not the end but one blip of a billion beginnings. He not only walks the world but crisscrosses the paths of history. ^rw148734387hl

>I was done thinking we were on an irreversible path to a fiery apocalypse. Because here's the thing: We truly don't know what the future holds or how climate change will play out or whether we will, in fact, all die a cruel skin-melting death under a merciless sun. I don't question the science; I question our ability as humans to predict anything. There's a lot that can happen between now and doomsday
>We're worried about a series of "positive feedbacks," in which one change in the environment can lead to another and another until the planet either turns into a smoldering Venus or a giant snowball. But there is such a thing as a "negative feedback," too. Kerry Emanuel, an MIT scientist and the author of What We Know About Climate Change, warns that we should be "wary of our own collective ignorance of how the climate system works. Perhaps negative-feedback mechanisms that we have not contemplated or have underestimated will kick in, sparing us debilitating consequences. . . Prediction beyond a certain time is impossible." This isn't an excuse to give up on conservation efforts because everything might turn out okay; it's a reason to keep working and caring and believing that our efforts matter. Perhaps it's best to believe, whether or not the end truly is coming, that the best of civilization will survive and our efforts will still be valued even if, regrettably, there is death and submerged islands and swamped coastines, too. ^rw148732186hl

>But not one person I encountered had said anything even halfway intelligent when denying global warming. No one had read books or articles on the issue, and they couldn't begin to understand how peer-reviewed science works. They saw themselves as too freewilled and independent to be duped into accepting something that an accomplished and well-trained scientist says is true. But these skeptics are only selectively skeptical. They think themselves enlightened for resisting all this new proof and remaining steadfast in mistrusting anything that someone else says. But it is a false enlightenment to accept only those ideas that align with one's worldview and reject those that don't. ^rw148729998hl

And having seen the toll that oil and pipeline jobs have on workers brings into question just how "good" these jobs really are. Although the pipeliners are well paid, they have to live far from their families in motels or trailer parks for months on end. And from what I saw, Fort McMurray, Alberta-where the oilmen of the tar sands live-is no Norman Rockwell painting
>Men aren't walking to work in hard hats each morning carrying lunch boxes and coming home to hugs and kisses from their children each night. Most all of the workers in Fort McMurray have left their families, and between the long hours, the morally ambiguous nature of their job, and the utter absence of spirituality and civic engagement in their lives, many turn to alcohol, drugs, gambling, and prostitutes. And it's obvious that many of them aren't putting their hard-earned dollars in cookie jars for rainy days but toward these fleeting enjoyments. ^rw148729762hl

>How does dying for my sins and my future sins make my sins any more forgivable? Why does this crazy story work for so many people
>And what's with this obsession with sinning? The more I thought about it, the more I realized that I don't really sin. I drink to be merry, I lie for the sake of social harmony, and I lust because I'm stuck with a twenty-nine-year-old-guy's body. I don't feel guilty for any of the above, as they aren't wrong, and when I do something wrong, my conscience catches it and I do my best to not do it again
>I didn't get the sense that Pastor James was preaching to me out of a sense of compassion or that he truly cared about the fate of my Soul. Rather, converting me was only a sort of game for him to play. As I sat on his couch in his church in my dusty clothes, he did not see me I sat there quietly, politely listening while thinking to myself, I'm smarter than all you fools. I knew that Pastor James, so blinded by his  faith, would never have an intellectual discussion for the rest of his life. I was tired of being lectured to by zealots and global-warming deniers

>Well, I have lots of time to think on my walk," I said to Pastor James, hoping that that would end the conversation, as he could then rest assured that he'd planted a seed of thought in my head and that I'd be mulling over his words of wisdom on my long walk. But all he heard was "I have lots of time

The service was about to start, so he plucked a pamphlet from a shelf titled, "Do you know for certain that you have ETERNAL LIFE?" and handed it to me with a look on his face that seemed to say, If I didn't get through to him, this will. ^rw148727061hl

>Part of this, no doubt, has to do with growing up in an area where one doesn't have many opportunities and where social mobility is stunted. Yet I could see that this poverty also derived from an almostself-expulsion flagrant isolationism, an extreme sense of privacy, a from society. Nearly every home had a fence around it and a snarling cur under the porch. There were countless signs reading BEWARE OF DOG, PRIVATE PROPERTY, and NO TRESPASSING. I presumed that it was just as unlikely for a neighbor to knock on one of these front doors as it was for an outsider. How could there be any sense of community when neighbors couldn't visit one another? How could we understand the world when we're secluded and holed up in hovels? And just as their homes are closed off to the outside world, so are many of their minds. I tried speaking with one man about climate change, and all he said was "Well, did you get that information from the liberal or the Democrat scientists? I tell you, there ain't no way I'm voting for someone who wants to make my gas more expensive." It was moments like these when I'd lose all hope for meaningful action on climate change. ^rw148723594hl

### The Ogallala Aquifer, as mentioned earlier, spreads out unde...
>The Ogallala Aquifer, as mentioned earlier, spreads out underneath eight Great Plains states from South Dakota to Texas. The aquifer contains three billion acre-feet of water (an acre-foot is the amount of water that it takes to cover one acre to the depth of one foot, so the Ogallala, theoretically, could cover all of Canada plus the states of Alaska, California, and Oregon in a foot of water). Because the plains get so little rain (less than an inch of which annually makes it down to refill the aquifer), the aquifer is being used up far faster than nature can refill it. Farmers use 19 million acre-feet a year, and 9 percent of the aquifer has been depleted since the 1950s. According to the National Academy of Sciences, Kansas has already depleted 30 percent of its share of the aquifer
>Plains farming is considered unsustainable because of the arid climate, the dust storms, and farmers' intemperate guzzling of the Ogal lala, but the most telling sign of the unsustainable nature of plaine farming may be the farmers' long history of depending on govern ment aid. From 1933 to 1939, the plains received one billion dollars ch as from federal programs. This relief, over the years, became an entirle ment that plains farmers expected and demanded after all ensuing droughts. In 1988, four billion dollars of federal money was dished out, mostly to the Dakotas, much of it to farmers, many of whom fraudulently claimed wind, rain, and hail damages. "Great Plains farmers," says Worster, "are unique only in the great extent of their dependency." Even though the plains are staunchly red states whose inhabitants complain about big government and entitlements, many of the people in this region are essentially welfare farmers. Of all farms in the country, 33 percent receive government payments, but on the plains, 55 percent do. The nation spends twenty billion dollars a year in direct crop subsidies, almost all of which goes to the states between the Rockies and the Mississippi River. If Montana didn't receive federal subsidies, author Richard Manning reports that the state's net farming income would be zero
>Despite the natural limits of plains farming, it will likely continue to intensify as long as there's aquifer water, fossil fuels, and government aid. When prices for crops rise and farmers can make a bigger profit, they don't hesitate to cut down old tree lines that functioned as wind breaks or turn marginal farmland (usually only good for cattle pasture) into fields of corn and soybean. Between 2006 and 2011, farmers in the Corn Belt (the Dakotas, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Iowa) turned 1.3 million acres of grassland (about the size of Delaware) into corn and soybeans because of what Nebraskans call "sevendollar corn." It's the biggest ongoing ecological crisis that no one knows about. ^rw148375094hl

After the plains were drowned by yet another ocean, gushing around the Rockies during the Cretaceous (between 145 million and 65 million years ago), the ocean receded again, opening up a wide and rolling soon-to-be-jungle expanse for herds of Triceratops and the solitary Tyrannosaurus rex that hunted them. Moths and bees inhabited the air while the Quetzalcoatlus, with its more than thirty-foot wingspan, soared in the skies. Frogs and salamanders were around then, too, as were a few of our justifiably terrified mouse-size mammalian ancestors. ^rw141878089hl

>For 55 million years (545 million to 490 million years ago), the plains were actually a great sea. This sea would come and go with changing climates and tectonic shifts, leaving behind gentle hills of sand, silt, and shells, which are now the wavy contours of our great grasslands
>During this period of dramatic tectonic plate movement, the plains to the west were thrust skyward, forming the Rocky Mountains. The Rockies began to erode as soon as they emerged, crumbling, blowing away, and being carried down the mountainside by creeks and rivers. The Great Plains were the giant dustbin that collected all the erosion from the newly formed and hardly tidy Rockies, which filled in the plains sea with piles of mud, sand, and volcanic ash. ^rw141877894hl

>We'd take care of each other, lift each other up when we were down, and, perhaps, like the Hobbits in moments of utter hopelessness, hold hands in that tender, brotherly, pre-twentieth-century, and not-at-allgay way. I imagined us on a journey of high adventure: escaping gunfire, taking cover from tornados, and maybe whispering in a moment of life-or-death suspense, with a hushed tone of poised determination: "Run." ^rw137491169hl

>But, truth be told, I was more a penniless and drifting tramp than a full-fledged and sponsored adventurer. Hitchhiking, anyway, is a lazy man's adventure, requiring only patience, the ability to endure hours of drivers' monologues, and a lot of sitting. I could boast of canoeing one thousand miles across Ontario, Canada, but that trip required more arms than legs and, again, an inadvisable amount of sitting. I'd also been a backcountry ranger up in the Gates of the Arctic National Park, a job that actually required that I did more than sit, but our patrols never lasted for more than a week at a time
>I'd done all those things years ago. Since then, I'd been a student-a designation that required I sit for hours, days, months(!) on end. My ass, once a sturdy hockey-player's hillock of meat and muscle, had, over the years, turned into a pale downward-leaning sack of fat, a drooping Salvador Dali clock that looked all the more pathetic on the body of an otherwise healthy twentysomething. ^rw137491035hl

I dropped the mixing bowl into the sink, looked at Liam, and said-with what must have been almost frightening excitement-"We must!" ^rw137387563hl

Comment: Ch 1  - Ken Ilgunas gets to Deadhorse Camp for a two week turn many month work stint. After a risky hike that turned out to be less risky than they imagined they decided to make it into something bigger: a walk along the length of the future Keystone XL pipeline. ^rw137387563comment

>There was something about being up in Deadhorse that made the idea of the 1,700-mile pipeline particularly upsetting. Here we were at ground zero of American oil development. We saw the industrial squalor, the depraved lifestyles, the sad, empty eyes of the workers. We felt the emptiness within ourselves. This place was an Ayn Rand wasteland, the epitome of our country's wrongheaded conception of "progress." The thought of creating more such places, more such jobs, and more such planet-warming greenhouse gases defied, in our eyes, all the tenets of good sense and reason. ^rw137387363hl

>Atop a pingo-a mound of earth-covered ice-the silhouette of an arctic fox appeared. It tilted its head back and unleashed a cackling howl. I strode past it, keeping an eye on it, worried that its screams would draw the eyes of prowling oilmen. When I looked forward, I saw Liam pumping his arms, running as fast as he could over land he couldn't see beneath him. I mimicked Liam's sprint until I got to where he was and dived behind another pingo. ^rw137387313hl

The wind from the mountains drove the nuns mad. It never stopped. It moved into their rooms, invading, molesting, reminding them, like a ghost, that this place is and always will be a place of kings and queens, jewels and perfumes, self-indulgence and debauchery, and that you can either accept that or die trying to change it. ^rw137387095hl

Because, as we were told, water cost thirty-five cents a gallon, it was no surprise that the water flowed from the shower nozzle at an exasperating dribble.
