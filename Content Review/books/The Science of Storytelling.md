>Some of our most successful mass-market storytellers also rely on information gaps.J. J. Abrams is co-creator of the longform television series Lost, which followed characters who mysteriously manage to survive an airline crash on a South Pacific island. There they discover mysterious polar bears; a mysterious band of ancient beings known as the Others'; a mysterious French woman; a mysterious ʻsmoke monster and a mysterious metal door in the ground. Fifteen million viewers in the US alone were drawn to watch that first series, in which a world was created then filled until psychedelic with information gaps. Abrams has described his controlling theory of storytelling as consisting of the opening of 'mystery boxes'. Mystery, he's said, 'is the catalyst for imagination

>A clever scientific study examining this process seems to have caught people in the act of "watching' the models of stories that their brains were busily building. Participants wore glasses that tracked their saccades. When they heard stories in which lots of events happened above the line of the horizon, their eyes kept making micro-movements upwards, as if they were actively scanning the models their brains were generating of its scenes. When they heard 'downward' stories, that's where their eyes went too. ^rw39164617hl

Comment: Interesting study about processing stories  talk about things above horizon and the listener looks upwards ^rw39164617comment

>Our brain rebuilds the model world that was originally imagined by the author of the story. This is the reality of Leo Tolstoy's brilliant assertion that 'a real work of art destroys, in the consciousness of the receiver, the separation between himself and the artist.' ^rw39164614hl

>According to Bergen, we start modelling words as soon as we start reading them. We don't wait until we get to the end of the sentence. This means the order in which writers place their words matters. This is perhaps why transitive construction - Jane gave a Kitten to her Dad – is more effective than the ditransitive - Jane gave her Dad a kitten. Picturing Jane, then the Kitten, then her Dad mimics the real-world action that we, as readers, should be modelling. It means we're mentally experiencing the scene in the correct sequence. Because writers are, in effect, generating neural movies in the minds of their readers, they should privilege word order that's filmic, imagining how their reader's neural camera will alight upon each component of a sentence. ^rw39164613hl

Comment: Interesting how we visualize as we read  order matters to help create a clearer image in your mind ^rw39164613comment
