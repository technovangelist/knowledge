>The Writer&#39;s Portable Mentor utilizes timed writing in a notebookcalled writing practice to guarantee productivity. In writing practice, developed by Natalie Goldberg in Writing Down the Bones and by Peter Elbow (in a form called &quot;freewriting&quot;) in Writing Without Teachers, the writer writes continuously without stopping for a period of time -_ CC (five minutes, ten minutes, a half-hour) set on a kitchen timer. Writing practice can be used to observe, to question a character (&quot;What do you want?&quot;), to write a scene, to conceptualize the next step or the next work, to write a character&#39;s backstory, to write from the point of view of a nonpoint-of-view character (to discover how this character actually views the situation rather than just faking his or her dialogue lines), to uncover memories, to write the entire draft of a book review, essay, or chapter. ^rw156632529hl

Comment: Should devs do something similar. 10 mins of free programming to build a simple tools using the concepts you know. ^rw156632529comment

>But the more skilled we become at our craft, the better we get at realizing works - completing them and making them good. &quot;Nothing we create,&quot; writes the novelist Walter Mosley, &quot;is art at first. It is simply a collection of notions that may never be understood. Returning every day thickens the atmosphere. Images appear. Connections are made
&gt;Walter Mosley, &quot;For Authors, Fragile Ideas Need Loving Every Day,&quot; 163-164. ^rw156632425hl

Comment: This reminds me of a video I saw recently about design patterns by Gang of Four. Don’t try to make the application perfect at first. Get it working then refactor applying patterns and make it more elegant and understandable . ^rw156632425comment
