>It is inconceivable,” said Herbert Hoover, secretary of commerce, at the first national radio conference in 1922, “that we should allow so great a possibility for service, for news, for entertainment, for education, and for vital commercial purposes to be drowned in advertising chatter.”1 Hoover’s remarks reflected the accepted wisdom of the times: that advertising on radio was unacceptable. That is to say, they reflected what radio broadcasting was in the early 1920s: a decentralized industry founded on a rather idealized notion of an emergent technology, the technological utopia of its time. ^rw35507058hl

>But Laemmle’s most important supporter was the sole exchange owner who’d refused to sell out, the owner of the Greater New York Film Rental Company, one Wilhelm Fuchs (later William Fox). Fox was another Jewish immigrant, albeit with a much harder life story than even Zukor’s. A destitute childhood on New York’s Lower East Side, selling candy and stove polish to support his family, had left him with a dead arm and a paranoid sensibility. ^rw35507055hl

>most of Laemmle’s peers, lacking the appetite to fight the Trust, either accepted the rules or gave up the business. In 1910, the Trust began to consolidate the film exchanges by systematically buying them out, acquiring, according to Upton Sinclair, 119 of the 120 major exchanges.13 Among those deciding to throw in the towel were three brothers, Jack, Sam, and Harry Warner. Harry Warner planned to become a grocer, and so, following an alternative course of history, Warner Bros. might today be a supermarket chain. ^rw35507054hl

>The American theaters, called “nickelodeons,” though wildly popular, had a reputation for unpleasantness. As a 1910 article in Moving Picture World described the experience: I would have been more comfortable on board a cattle train than where I sat. There were five hundred smells combined in one. One young lady fainted and had to be carried out of the theater. I can forgive that, all right, as people with sensitive noses should not go slumming. But what is hardest to swallow is that the tastes of this seething mass of human cattle are the tastes that have dominated.3 ^rw35507052hl

>Western Union’s telephone network was designed not to pose any threat to the telegraph business. In an oft-exampled way, a dominant power must disable or neuter its own inventions to avoid cannibalizing its core business. In the 1980s and 1990s, General Motors, famously, was fully equipped to take over the electric car market, but was restrained by disinclination to create a rival to the internal combustion engine, its main business. ^rw35507051hl

>Bell’s first telephone simply did not work very well. The Bell Company’s most valuable asset would remain, for some time, the principal patent, for actual telephones were more like toys than devices adults could depend on. Finding investors, let alone customers, was such tough going that at one point, according to most accounts, Hubbard, acting as Bell’s president, offered Western Union all of Bell’s patents for $100,000. William Orton, president of Western Union, refused, in one of history’s less prudent exercises of business judgment. ^rw35507050hl

>Hayes, far from being the front-runner, had gained the Republican nomination only on the seventh ballot. But as the polls closed his persistence appeared a waste of time, for Tilden, the Democrat, held a clear advantage in the popular vote (by a margin of over 250,000) and seemed headed for victory according to most early returns; by some accounts Hayes privately conceded defeat. But late that night, Reid, the New York Times editor, alerted the Republican Party that the Democrats, despite extensive intimidation of Republican supporters, remained unsure of their victory in the South. The GOP sent some telegrams of its own to the Republican governors in the South with special instructions for manipulating state electoral commissions. As a result the Hayes campaign abruptly claimed victory, resulting in an electoral dispute that would make Bush v. Gore seem a garden party. After a few brutal months, the Democrats relented, allowing Hayes the presidency—in exchange, most historians believe, for the removal of federal troops from the South, effectively ending Reconstruction. ^rw35507046hl

>Working closely with the Republican Party and avowedly Republican papers like The New York Times (the ideal of an unbiased press would not be established for some time, and the minting of the Times’s liberal bona fides would take longer still), they did what they could to throw the election to Hayes. It was easy: the AP ran story after story about what an honest man Hayes was, what a good governor he had been, or just whatever he happened to be doing that day. It omitted any scandals related to Hayes, and it declined to run positive stories about his rivals (James Blaine in the primary, Samuel Tilden in the general). But beyond routine favoritism, late that Election Day Western Union offered the Hayes campaign a secret weapon that would come to light only much later. ^rw35507045hl

>his greatest advantage was neither of these. It was that everyone else was obsessed with trying to improve the telegraph. By the 1870s inventors and investors understood that there could be such a thing as a telephone, but it seemed a far-off, impractical thing. Serious men knew that what really mattered was better telegraph technology. Inventors were racing to build the “musical telegraph,” a device that could send multiple messages over a single line at the same time. The other holy grail was a device for printing telegrams at home.* ^rw35507042hl

>In 1861, sixteen years before Bell, a German man named Johann Philip Reis presented a primitive telephone to the Physical Society of Frankfurt, claiming that “with the help of the galvanic current, [the inventor] is able to reproduce at a distance the tones of instruments and even, to a certain degree, the human voice.” Germany has long considered Reis the telephone’s inventor. Another man, a small-town Pennsylvania electrician named Daniel Drawbaugh, later claimed that by 1869 he had a working telephone in his house. He produced prototypes and seventy witnesses who testified that they had seen or heard his invention at that time. In litigation before the Supreme Court in 1888, three Justices concluded that “overwhelming evidence” proved that “Drawbaugh produced and exhibited in his shop, as early as 1869, an electrical instrument by which he transmitted speech.…”* 3 ^rw35507034hl
