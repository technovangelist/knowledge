>The monarchy that the British so obligingly gave to the Iraqi people would, in the long run, produce as many problems as it supplied solutions. Faisal, the new king, was a thirty-eight-year-old Sunni from the Hejaz, on the Red Sea, to the west of the modern kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and he had spent his earliest years among the Bedouin tribesmen. ^rw35507347hl

### The most famous man at the conference of the ‘forty thieves’...
>The most famous man at the conference of the ‘forty thieves’, as Churchill called it, was undoubtedly T. E. Lawrence, an ‘object at once of awe and pity’.44 Lawrence continues to fascinate Western minds, influenced perhaps unduly by what is perceived to be the romance of the East. His participation in Iraqi affairs was peripheral, despite the fact that regarded himself as a ‘foundation-member’ of the new kingdom of Iraq.45 Lawrence famously was convinced of the need for the Arabs to be independent. He boasted as much to Charlotte Shaw, the wife of the playwright George Bernard Shaw, declaring that he had been ‘right to work for Arab self-government through 1919 and 1920’. The self-government he had in mind was a figment of his own romantic imagination. Despite his vaunted support for the cause of Arab self-determination, Lawrence told Mrs Shaw in the same letter that the Arabs were not yet ready for the self-government he had so generously conceived for them. ‘As for Irak [sic] . . . some day they will be fit for self-government and then they will not want a king: but whether 7 or 70 or 700 years hence, God knows.’46 He was clear that until the Iraqis proved ‘fit’ for self-government they would have to make do with a king, provided by Britain. ^rw35507346hl

>Britain’s empire in the Middle East had come into being only as a result of the defeat and collapse of the Ottoman Empire. There was little infrastructure in Whitehall, the centre of the imperial government in London, from which to administer the new empire in the Middle East. Nominally, the Foreign Office was responsible for Palestine, Egypt and the Sudan, while the India Office was responsible for the Gulf and Iraq. ^rw35507344hl

>Bell herself dismissed the Koran as ‘entirely irrelevant to human affairs and worthless in any branch of human activity’. The Muslims’ religious customs had made things particularly difficult for her, a Western woman. She had been ‘until quite recently’ completely ‘cut off from them because their tenets forbid them to look upon an unveiled woman and my tenets don’t permit me to veil’. ^rw35507340hl

>Sir Ronald Storrs, the great oriental civil administrator, described the attitude well, in a lecture delivered to the University of Leicester in 1932, when he accused the British of not being ‘good mixers’. He went on to say that ‘some of our officials, and I regret to say their ladies also, are apt to stand on their dignity in dealing with the men and women with whom they are thrown in contact’. ^rw35507339hl

>The empire was full of civil servants, polished officials of sophisticated literary education, who turned a blind eye to the more sordid, commercial aspects of the imperial mission. This is perhaps what Harry St John Philby, father of the Soviet spy Kim Philby, meant when he suggested that Gertrude Bell, for all her ability, ‘had no half-tones in her repertoire’. ^rw35507338hl

>On 1 December 1918, barely three weeks after the end of the war, Georges Clemenceau, the French Prime Minister, had met David Lloyd George, his British opposite number, at 10 Downing Street. There they both agreed that Mosul should form part of British-controlled Iraq. By way of compensation, France was to get 25 per cent of the oil produced in the province.11 ^rw35507333hl
