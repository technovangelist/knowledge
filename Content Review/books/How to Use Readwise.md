>Support for highlights from PDFs is one of our most requested features. Unfortunately, PDFs are a super fickle file format and there's no great existing solution that we know of for highlighting and exporting from PDF. That said, we intend to solve the PDF highlighting problem soon once we develop the Readwise native mobile app. ^rw33272728hl

>If you're an avid highlighter of Kindle books, you've probably encountered the Kindle highlight limit. Basically, for copyright reasons, many publishers set limitations on how much of a book you can export through highlights. For example, if you highlight more than 10% of many books, those highlights above the limit will be truncated with a "...". We understand how incredibly frustrating this can be because often the books we highlight the most are the ones we most want to post-process! Unfortunately, we have no way around this limit at this time. ^rw33272724hl

>There are two ways to handle books and articles you don't want to see in Readwise. The first method is to set the book's frequency to "Never" from the [Books](https://readwise.io/library) menu. The book will continue to be accessible from your library, but its highlights will not be resurfaced in your Daily Readwises. The second method is to delete the book so that it does not appear anywhere in Readwise. You can do this from the [Books](https://readwise.io/library) menu as well. Note that if you delete a book, Readwise will not re-import the book on subsequent resyncs. ^rw33272718hl

>Have you ever found yourself highlighting an entire fluff-filled paragraph even though all you really wanted were the key sentences at the beginning and end? You can cut this fluff by taking special notes while you read. These notes instruct Readwise to combine multiple, non-adjacent highlights into a single annotation. Simply highlight the first string of text you want to combine and add the note .c1 ("c" for "concatenate"). Then, highlight the second string of text and add the note .c2. Upon importing into Readwise, these two highlights will be combined into a single annotation.

>Did you know you can add chapters to your highlights in Readwise? In addition, you can generate a nifty table of contents which you can use to quickly navigate a book and refresh your memory of the book's organization. You add this chapter data by taking a special note while you read. Simply highlight the title of each section and add a note beginning with a period (.) followed by an h (for "heading") and then the number 1 through 3 representing the section's position in the hierarchy.
For example, with a book organized into parts, chapters, and sections, you would denote all parts as .h1, all chapters as .h2, and all sections as .h3. Read more here: [How to Add Chapters to Your Highlights in Readwise](https://blog.readwise.io/add-chapters-to-highlights/). ^rw33272712hl

>Do you ever wish that your highlights were tagged with useful keywords and categories, but never bothered because the process of tagging is just too cumbersome? There's an easy way to tag your highlights, found only in Readwise called, inline tagging. An inline tag is a special note taken while you read that's automatically converted into a tag in Readwise. Tagging in the moment is much faster than tagging after the fact, and once your highlights have keywords and categories, they're much easier to review and reference. Simply highlight a passage and add a note beginning with a period (.) followed by a single word or abbreviation (with no spaces). You can also train Readwise to interpret shorthand!

>COMING SOON! In addition to the general purpose methods for mastering a passive highlight in Readwise (cloze deletion and question & answer), there's also a special active recall method called term. If you pay attention, much of any nonfiction book is spent "coming to terms" in which the author carefully explains what he or she means by specific words. Sometimes authors even introduces new terms. For example, the term antifragile in Nassim Taleb's Antifragile. If you master the terms in a nonfiction book, your understanding will skyrocket compared to a passive reading. To convert a highlight to a term, hit the Master icon in the web app (keyboard shortcut m).  ^rw33272708hl

Then type your question to your future self ending with a question mark followed by the answer. When this highlight is resurfaced in Readwise, it will be in the form of a question. Talk about retaining what you read! ^rw33272706hl

>NEW! Readwise offers increasing degrees of active recall intensity (Mastery). The least demanding is cloze deletion, but the most powerful is question & answer. Q&A is exactly what it sounds like: You convert a passage containing a piece of wisdom you wish to master into a question paired with the answer. The next time you see the highlight, you'll be prompted with the question, forcing you to actively recall the answer. This is scientifically proven to form stronger memories enabling you to retain profoundly more of what you've read.

>Readwise offers increasing degrees of active recall intensity (Mastery). The least demanding is a deceptively simple technique called [cloze deletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test), more commonly known as "fill in the blank". With cloze deletion, a salient keyword is hidden from the passage, giving you an opportunity to pause and actively recall the missing information. This might sound trivial, but the simple act forces you to focus on the surrounding context and search your mind. This effort, in turn, is scientifically proven to form stronger memories enabling you to retain profoundly more of what you've read. To apply cloze deletion to a highlight, hit the Master icon in the web app (keyboard shortcut m).  ^rw33272702hl

>Readwise helps you remember more of what you read using two principles borrowed from cognitive science: [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) and [active recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_recall). Active recall (also known as quizzing, testing, or retrieval) is the process by which we challenge our minds to retrieve a piece of information. Simply rereading a passage from time to time, on the other hand, is passive. Rereading is no doubt better than never revisiting the passage, but research has repeatedly shown that active recall is significantly more effective. So how can you take advantage of active recall in Readwise? For any highlight that you wish to deliberately commit to memory, hit the Master icon in the web app (keyboard shortcut m). You can then convert that highlight from a passive passage to be reread to a flashcard to be actively recalled. In turn, you'll retain vastly more of what you read. ^rw33272700hl

>When you start using Readwise, its proprietary [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) algorithm assumes by default that each of your highlights is of equal quality, equal relevance, and equal difficulty. For most people, this is not entirely true. Some highlights are better than average; some are below. Some highlights are especially relevant right now; some not so much. Some highlights are hard to remember; some are easy
>You can take control of this algorithm by supplying feedback in the web app. If a highlight is better than average, especially relevant, or difficult, instruct Readwise "More" (keyboard shortcut 2). You'll see this highlight more often than average. If a highlight is in the middle, instruct Readwise "Later" (keyboard shortcut 3). You get the idea. If you consistently supply feedback, you'll watch the quality of your reviews steadily improve. In turn, you'll retain significantly more of what you read. ^rw33272698hl

>Readwise helps you remember more of what you read using two principles borrowed from cognitive science: [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) and [active recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_recall). Spaced repetition is a scientifically proven method for efficient learning that progressively increases the time between reviews of previously learned material. Basically, we remember things better if we spread our reviews out over time rather than cramming. If you stop to think about it, reading a book is kind of like cramming. We intensely learn about a single subject for a few weeks. Then we move onto the next book. Readwise uses your highlights from to space out each book you've read into perpetuity. The result is that your retain profoundly more of what you read. ^rw33272696hl

>Why does Readwise focus so much on retention? For the same reasons that founders should reduce churn in a SaaS business before investing in growth; or investors should buffer their portfolios against losses before seeking gains; or bodybuilders should prevent muscle loss before adding lean mass. No matter what you’re doing, the best way to grow is to first prevent losses
>Think of it this way: If you've got a leaky bucket, you're better off fixing the leak before pouring water in the top. For those of you who prefer numbers: If you start with a portfolio worth $100 and lose 50%, you now need to earn 100% to breakeven.
This principle, of course, also extends to learning. ^rw33272694hl

Going forward, the probability this book is resurfaced will be increased.

>Is there a particular book that pops up a little too frequently in your Daily Readwises? Or maybe there's a book that you wish you saw more often? You can increase or decrease the frequencies of each book or article using a feature called "tuning". Simply select the [Preferences](https://readwise.io/preferences) menu from the [Readwise Dashboard](https://readwise.io/dashboard) and toggle the Customize Books or Customize Articles option. For users with many books, this is one of the most powerful features in Readwise. Pro tip: You can also increase or decrease the frequency of a particular book conveniently during your Daily Readwise. ^rw33272690hl

>It's not uncommon for a Readwise user to have more than 10,000 highlights in his or her catalog. If this user reviews 10 highlights per Daily Readwise, it'd take nearly three years to go through them all (assuming no new highlights during that time!). Because of this, we've built a "resurfacing algorithm" which tries to show you the "right highlight at the right time" kind of like Spotify trying to serve up daily mixes based on your listening history. The Readwise algorithm also enables you to take control and manually "tune" many of its settings. You can do this by selecting the [Preferences](https://readwise.io/preferences) menu from the [Readwise Dashboard](https://readwise.io/dashboard) and toggling the various settings. ^rw33272688hl

>The Readwise web app has two views which we call "Scroll Mode" and "Review Mode". Scroll Mode displays highlights vertically. This is great for quick scanning, juxtaposing highlights, or Cmd/Ctrl + Fing with a search term. Review Mode displays highlights one at a time in a horizontal view. This is great for focusing all your attention on a single passage and taking actions, such as tagging, noting, or spaced repetition, before moving on to the next. You can switch between these views by toggling the button in the upper right corner of the Readwise web app or using the keyboard shortcut ll. ^rw33272686hl

>At the end of every Daily Readwise, you'll discover a "bonus highlight" from a book recommended specifically for you. Our recommendation algorithm uses the books you've actually read, and how intensely you've read each, to predict books we think you'll actually love. In contrast, most online retailers try to predict books they think you'll buy. The bonus highlight is a feature and we do not make any affiliate revenue off of these links. You can turn off the bonus highlight any time by selecting [Preferences](https://readwise.io/preferences) from the [Readwise Dashboard](https://readwise.io/dashboard) and toggling the Bonus Highlights option.  ^rw33272683hl

>One of the nice things about having all your highlights synchronized in a single repository is that it's easy to retrieve the excerpt you're looking for. You can hunt for a particular highlight by browsing the particular [Book](https://readwise.io/library) or [Article](https://readwise.io/articles), by using your [Tags](https://readwise.io/tags), or, of course, by using good old fashioned search. A search box is displayed in the upper right corner of most Readwise screens. Alternatively, you can go to the [Search](https://readwise.io/search) page to query your entire Readwise catalog. ^rw33272681hl

>The first time you see a highlight resurfaced in Readwise, it will have a blue dot in the upper left corner. This indicates that the highlight is still "unprocessed" similar to an unread email. Once you read the highlight or perform an action, the highlight will then be considered "processed". This is helpful for readers wishing to systematically review all their highlights, either in whole or for particular books. You can also mouseover the dot to see additional data, such as when you originally took the highlight. ^rw33272677hl

>Let's be honest: Many of our highlights are not so good. Maybe we highlighted a fragment because of Kindle's annoying refresh rate. Maybe we highlighted a passage that made sense in the moment, but makes no sense now. Either way, if Readwise resurfaces a highlight that's unlikely to have any future value to you, you should "discard" it. You discard in the Readwise Email by clicking the Discard link underneath each highlight. You discard in the Readwise web app by clicking the Discard button or using the keyboard shortcut d.

>Readwise isn't limited to just books. You can also use it with highlights from articles. There are myriad apps out there, but our favorite by far is Instapaper. The Instapaper reading experience is silky smooth and they offer an API which we can use to seamlessly synchronize with Readwise every highlight you take. To connect your Instapaper account select the [Add Highlights](https://readwise.io/sync) menu from the [Readwise Dashboard](https://readwise.io/dashboard) and click on the [Instapaper](https://readwise.io/instapaper) link. ^rw33272637hl

>Any time you highlight a book or document that was manually loaded onto your Kindle device (rather than purchased directly from Amazon), that highlight is saved to a local text file called My Clippings.txt. You can upload this file to Readwise to add all those highlights from sideloaded documents to your account. Upload My Clippings.txt by selecting the [Add Highlights](https://readwise.io/sync) menu from the [Readwise Dashboard](https://readwise.io/dashboard) and clicking on the [My Clippings](https://readwise.io/import_clippings) link. ^rw33272635hl

>Consistently revisiting the best part of our ebooks is great, but how can we do the same for paper and audiobooks? At first, we didn't have a solution for these books. Now we do. You can add paper and audiobooks to a special shelf in Readwise. After doing so, you'll start receiving their most popular passages as part of your Daily Readwise (provided we have enough data). It's not the same as revisiting your own highlights, but it's surprisingly close! You can add those books by selecting the [Add Highlights](https://readwise.io/sync) menu from the [Readwise Dashboard](https://readwise.io/dashboard) and clicking on the [Paper or Audiobooks](https://readwise.io/quick) link. ^rw33272633hl

>Even though Amazon Kindle commands a staggering share of the ebook market (some reports suggest north of 90%!), Readwise also supports highlights from Apple iBooks. You can synchronize your iBooks highlights by selecting the [Add Highlights](https://readwise.io/sync) menu from the [Readwise Dashboard](https://readwise.io/dashboard) and clicking on the [iBooks](https://readwise.io/ibooks) link. You'll need to follow the instructions from there. ^rw33272631hl
