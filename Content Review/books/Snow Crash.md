>And then she figured out the whole situation in, maybe, ten minutes, just by watching my face across the dinner table. I didn't say more than ten words—‘Pass the tortillas.' I don't know how my face conveyed that information, or what kind of internal wiring in my grandmother's mind enabled her to accomplish this incredible feat.

There is one on her wrist, but she doesn't slap at it. The spotlight lingers for a minute. The broad square of the pizza box, bearing the CosaNostra logo, is mute testimony.

You never know when something will be useful, so you might as well videotape it. ^rw35507231hl
