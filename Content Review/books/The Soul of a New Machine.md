>IBM took advantage of the trend. They announced, in the mid-sixties, all at one time, an entire family of new computers—the famous 360 line. In the commerce of computers, no single event has had wider significance, except for the invention of the transistor. Part of the 360’s importance lay in the fact that all the machines in the family were software compatible. ^rw35507389hl

>Computer engineers call a single high or low voltage a bit, and it symbolizes one piece of information. One bit can’t symbolize much; it has only two possible states, so it can, for instance, be used to stand for only two integers. Put many bits in a row, however, and the number of things that can be represented increases exponentially. By way of analogy, think of telephone numbers. Using only four digits, the phone company could make up enough unique numbers to give one to everybody in a small town. But what if the company wants to give everyone in a large region a unique phone number? By using seven instead of four digits, Ma Bell can generate a vast array of unique numbers, enough so that everyone in the New York metropolitan area or in the state of Montana can have one of his own. Inside certain crucial parts of a typical modern computer, the bits—the electrical symbols—are handled in packets. Like phone numbers the packets are of a standard size. IBM’s machines have traditionally handled information in packages 32 bits long. Data General’s NOVA and most minicomputers after it, including the Eclipses, deal with packages only 16 bits long. The distinction is inconsequential in theory, since any computer is hypothetically capable of doing what any other computer may do. But the ease and speed with which different computers can be made to perform the same piece of work vary widely, and in general a machine that handles symbols in chunks of 32 bits runs faster, and for some purposes—usually large ones—it is easier to program than a machine that handles only 16 bits at a time. ^rw35507388hl

>Computers, it is often said, manipulate symbols. They don’t deal with numbers directly, but with symbols that can represent not only numbers but also words and pictures. Inside the circuits of the digital computer these symbols exist in electrical form, and there are just two basic symbols—a high voltage and a low voltage. Clearly, this is a marvelous kind of symbolism for a machine; the circuits don’t have to distinguish between nine different shades of gray but only between black and white, or, in electrical terms, between high and low voltages. ^rw35507387hl

He walked into a building, just as though he belonged there, went down a hallway, and let himself quietly into a windowless room. The floor was torn up; a sort of trench filled with fat power cables traversed it. Along the far wall, at the end of the trench, stood a brand-new example of DEC’s VAX, enclosed in several large cabinets that vaguely resembled refrigerators. But to West’s surprise, one of the cabinets stood open and a man with tools was standing in front of it. A technician from ^rw35507385hl

>Early in 1979 the businessman who told me about Data General’s problems and recovery back in ’73 hit upon a heroic metaphor for success in the computer business. “The major thing,” he said, “is avoiding the big mistake. It’s like downhill ski racing: Can you stay right on that edge beside disaster? At Data General we keep coming up with these things that are basically acts of recovery. What Tom West and his people are doing is a great act of recovery.” ^rw35507380hl

>Looking for an opinion that was certain to be disinterested, I asked an old friend, a veteran analyst of securities, to take a look at Data General’s numbers. He had the advantage of never having followed the company before, and in return for anonymity he agreed to my proposal. A couple of weeks later, he called me back. It seemed to him that Data General was bent on continuing to grow at 30 to 40 percent a year. He pointed out that this meant large growth in everything—in the need for capital, new buildings, new employees. Between 1974 and 1978, for instance, Data General had hired about 7,000 new employees, roughly tripling its numbers; in one year alone the company had increased its ranks by 71 percent. The analyst imagined the difficulties of finding that many qualified people so quickly. And what must it be like, he asked, to work at a place like that? You’d come to work some morning and suddenly find yourself in charge of a dozen new people, or suddenly beneath a new boss to whom you would have to prove yourself all over again. “That sort of growth puts a strain on everything,” the analyst concluded. “It’s gonna be intriguing to see if they get caught.” He thanked me for putting him onto such a marvelous entertainment. ^rw35507379hl

>The company had displayed extravagance when it came to financing its tendency to go to court. Otherwise, the management seemed bent on saving all their cash to feed the hungry beast of growth. And, of course, the more this beast gets fed, the bigger it becomes, the more it wants to eat. It is one thing for a company with revenues of a million dollars a year to grow 30 or 40 percent in a year and quite another for a half-a-billion-dollar company to pull off the same trick. ^rw35507378hl

>But no company whose primary business was making computers had grown more rapidly than Data General. Bursts of growth were not uncommon, but Data General had been bursting for a decade, and what’s more, it had been maintaining the highest profit margins in the industry next to IBM’s. All this would have impressed the analyst from Wall Street, of course, but would also have given him pause. ^rw35507377hl

>DEC actually gave them some help in setting up “the Hertz-Avis thing.” DEC’s management, he said, ordered their salesmen to warn their customers against Data General. “It was great! Because their customers hadn’t heard about us.” Kluchman imagined DEC’s salesmen telling DEC’s customers that a dangerous new company was on the prowl, and DEC’s customers responding to this news by saying, “Where is this Data General, so we can be sure to avoid them? What’s Data General’s phone number, so we’ll be sure not to call it?” Kluchman laughed. “The calls just rolled in. DEC’s customers would say, ‘We hear you’re bad guys. You must be doing something we oughta know about.’ ” ^rw35507376hl

>IBM would say, ‘You got a problem, Mr. Customer? A team of four will be there in an hour.’ Implicitly a Data General would say to its customers, ‘You have to look out for yourselves.’ The sophisticated customer, particularly the OEM who buys a lot of computers and looks for discounts, not service, goes for minis. They’re capable of living in a rough-and-tumble world. And I’m not sure that IBM, with its organization, can compete in the traditional minicomputer market. It’s like putting a goldfish in a bowl with a piranha.” ^rw35507374hl
