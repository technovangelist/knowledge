>First I write a sentence. I get a tickle of an idea for how the words might come together, like an angler feeling a tug on the rodâ€™s line. Then I sound out the sentence in my head. Then I tap it on my keyboard, trying to recall its shape. Then I look at it and say it aloud, to see if it sings. Then I tweak, rejig, shave off a syllable, swap a word for a phrase or a phrase for a word. Then I sit it next to other sentences to see how it behaves in company. And then I delete it all and start again. ^rw42991952hl
