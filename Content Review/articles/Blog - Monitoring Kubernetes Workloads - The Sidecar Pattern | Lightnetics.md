&gt;The Kubernetes hosts running the Kubelet. The most common way to get data out of these hosts is to use the Prometheus node exporter, which scrapes data from the Kubernetes host and exposes system resource telemetry data on an HTTP endpoint.
The Kubernetes process, AKA Kubelet metrics. These provide details on Kubernetes nodes and the jobs they run.
The Kubeletâ€™s built-in cAdvisor, which helps keep track of resource usage for running containers.
Kube-state-metrics for a big picture view at the Kubernetes cluster level. ^rw153357599hl

>Examples of Kubernetes sidecars include
&gt;Service mesh
Logging platforms with agents that run as sidecars
Monitoring solutions like Sensu with an agent that runs as a sidecar, giving you a 1:1 pairing of a monitoring agent per collection of services. ^rw153387231hl
