>Kubelet is one of the most important components in Kubernetes. Basically, itâ€™s an agent that runs on each node and is responsible for watching the API Server for pods that are bound to its node and making sure those pods are running (it talks to the Docker daemon using the API over the Docker socket to manipulate containers lifecycle). It then reports back to the API Server the status of changes regarding those pods ^rw140166144hl
