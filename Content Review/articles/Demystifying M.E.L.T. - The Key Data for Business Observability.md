>Metrics are the starting point for observability. They’re an aggregated set of measurements grouped or collected at regular intervals. Most share several traits: a timestamp, a name, one or more numeric values and a count of how many events are represented. Metric examples include error rate, response time, or throughput. ^rw230453402hl

>An event is a discrete action happening at any moment in time. Take a vending machine for instance. An event could be the moment when a user makes a purchase from the machine. There might be states that are derived from other events, such as a product becoming sold out after a purchase. ^rw230453414hl

>However, events are often overlooked or can be confused with logs. What’s the difference? Events contain a higher level of abstraction than the level of detail provided by logs. Logs record everything, whereas events are records of selected significant things. ^rw230453427hl

>Adding metadata to events makes them much more powerful. With the vending machine example, we could add additional attributes such as “ItemCategory” and “PaymentType”. This allows questions to be asked, such as &quot;How much money was made from each item category?&quot; or &quot;What is the most common payment type used?” ^rw230453429hl

>Log data is sometimes unstructured which makes it hard to parse in a systematic way, but when log data is structured, it’s much easier to search the data and derive events or metrics from it. ^rw230453433hl

>Traces are samples of causal chains of events, and trace data is needed to determine the relationships between different entities. Traces are very valuable for highlighting inefficiencies, bottlenecks and roadblocks in the customer journey, as they can be used to show the end-to-end latency of individual calls in a distributed architecture. ^rw230453446hl
