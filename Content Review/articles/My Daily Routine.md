>I don’t let myself use the internet before this point in my day. It scatters my attention, but more importantly, I find that filling my head with others’ voices exacerbates It’s hard to hear yourself think. ^rw141872878hl

Comment: This daily routine looks very interesting

- Pre-desk
    - Wake (around 6:30)
    - Body-weight exercises
    - Shower
    - Walk, train, and feed my dog
    - Meditate
    - Make small coffee (10g / 150mL)
- First morning block (~7:30 – 10)
    - Start a Daily working log, write for a minute or so about how I’m feeling and my intentions for the day
    - Do My morning writing practice, usually until around 10:00
      - I alternate between 35 minute periods of focused unitasking and 5 minute breaks, during which I walk around the house and pick up, do mise en place for dinner, etc.
    - Make small coffee (10g / 150 mL)
- Second morning working block (~10 – noon)
  - I eat lunch at my desk around 11:30. It’s usually Quiche.
- Mid-day break: dog park or long walk with Shabu (~noon – 1)
- Third working block (~1 – 4)
  - This is often my very execution-oriented working block. I find that my creative focus is sharper in the morning, and in the afternoon I mostly want to knock out tasks.
- Late afternoon:
  - Around 4:00, I’ll meet up with collaborators or do administrative work. I’m usually pretty fried at this point.
  - If I have meetings, they usually start at 5:00, and they’re usually walking meetings. I very rarely take meetings before 4:00.
- Evening:
  - I cook dinner every weeknight around 6.
    - I try to have friends over for dinner at least one night a week.
  - After that, it’s usually reading, piano practice, and time with Sara until bedtime at 10. ^rw141871721comment
