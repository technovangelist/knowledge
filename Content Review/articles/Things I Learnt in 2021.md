>But even before the war, bidets were linked to sex and scandal. In the United States and Britain, when various forms of douching were thought of as a pregnancy preventive, bidets were considered a form of birth control. As Norman Haire, a birth-control pioneer, put it in 1936, “The presence of a bidet is regarded as almost a symbol of sin.” The present-day American sociologist Harvey Molotch agrees, concluding that the devices were tainted with France’s hedonism and sexuality. “Bidets have had such diffic ^rw264677165hl

>Pringles Salt &amp; Vinegar is not vegan, while Pringles Smokey Bacon is vegan ¶   That&#39;s quite hilarious:    The main reason that some Pringles varieties are not suitable for vegans is their inclusion of one or more ingredients derived from dairy products (for instance the milk-derived lactose in the Salt &amp; Vinegar flavoured Pringles). ^rw264677183hl

>I never considered eating silica gel packages, but I never thought they are edible either. Apparently eating them is not dangerous, and now I am not sure what to do with that knowledge.    Although the packages say, “Do not eat,” they aren’t actually toxic. They are filled with little silicon dioxide beads, and the only real danger associated with them is that they could pose a choking hazard for young children. ^rw264677187hl

>Cholmondeley, Cheshire ¶   This is pronounced &#x2F;ˈtʃʌmli&#x2F; CHUM-lee and now you have to live with this knowledge too.    Cholmondeley is a civil parish in Cheshire, England, north east of Malpas and west of Nantwich.    Can&#39;t imagine what the locals go through whenever someone asks them to spell the name. ^rw264677476hl

### If the pressure in the cabin changes and masks drop, tugging...
>If the pressure in the cabin changes and masks drop, tugging the mask causes a pin to ignite a smal explosion which combines sodium chlorate and potassium perchlorate to make oxygen.    The reaction goes on until the chemicals are exhausted. So, once the mask is pulled, it can provide breathable oxygen for 12-20 minutes, depending on the type and size of the oxygen generator. At any rate, you only need the ‘mask oxygen’ until the plane descends to 10,000 feet, as the surrounding air will become breathable ^rw264678746hl

>Something very unexpected: the artificial banana flavouring tastes so different from the real banana flavour because it was built upon a variety that is now extinct. And its flavour was very close.    Remember how isoamyl acetate is the chemical compound primarily responsible for banana flavoring? Gros Michel contains more of that compound than the Cavendish. In fact, isoamyl acetate was one of the first chemical compounds used in artificial flavors that was confirmed to exist in the actual fruit as well. ^rw264678777hl

>Designing cities is hard, and numbering streets is not an easy feast, but Florence, WTF?    A double sequence of street numbering exists in Florence. Shops and businesses are identified by the letter &#39;R&#39; after the number. This signifies &#39;red&#39;. Private residences are numbered in black. Thus a street may have two number 18&#39;s, at times at considerable distance one from the other; 18R (as in the addresses given here) is a shop or business, while 18 is a private house.    Luckily, modern buildings don&#39;t rely o ^rw264678779hl
