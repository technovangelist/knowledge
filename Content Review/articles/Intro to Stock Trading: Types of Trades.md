>Bracketed orders go one step further than trailing stop orders. Just like the latter type of order, with a bracketed order, you set a trailing stop as either a percentage or fixed amount below the stock price. However, you can also establish an upper limit that, when reached, will result in the stock being sold ^rw146298771hl

>Imagine you purchased 500 shares of Coca-Cola at $50 per share. The current price is $58. You want to lock in at least $5 of the per share profit you’ve made but wish to continue holding the stock, hoping to benefit from any further increases. To meet your objective, you could place a trailing stop order with a stop value of $3 per share
>If the stock price does what you had hoped it would do, your order will sit on your broker’s books and automatically adjust upwards as the price of Coca-Cola’s common stock increases. At the time your trailing stop order is placed, your broker knows to sell your shares if the stock price falls below $55 ($58 current market price - $3 trailing stop loss = $55 sale price
>Imagine Coca-Cola increases steadily to $62 per share. Now, your trailing stop order has automatically kept pace and will convert to a market order at $59 ($62 current market price - $3 trailing stop loss = $59 sale price). That would provide a gain of $9 per share. ^rw146298770hl

>One way to protect gains and limit losses automatically is by placing a trailing stop order. With this kind of order, you set a stop price as either a spread in points or a percentage of current market value. ^rw146298769hl
