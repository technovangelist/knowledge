>Metal is a strong thermal conductor, and when you stick your tongue on a very cold pole, it pulls the heat away from the saliva that coats your tongueâ€™s nooks and crannies. That moisture then freezes, bonding your tongue to the pole. The key to getting your tongue unstuck is thus to melt that bond. If you have a pal around who can procure a vessel of warm (not hot!) liquid, he can pour it on the pole to thaw things out. ^rw264409476hl
