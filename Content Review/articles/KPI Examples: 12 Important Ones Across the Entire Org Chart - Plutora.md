>customer retention rate shows how many customers are staying versus leaving the company. This KPI example is usually calculated as a percentage within a certain time period. An example would be the customer retention rate for the year 2020. It reveals how sticky the products or services being delivered are. A low retention rate is undesirable as it suggests that customers are signing up and transacting only once or a few times before leaving for another service provider ^rw230489770hl

>Increases in monthly new leads often also increase the total new customer count for a given time period. Several campaigns come together to produce an overall new leads count. Fewer leads can be a result of general depression in the market as a whole. However, it also indicates that more effort is required on the part of the company’s marketing teams. All companies crave high new leads numbers. ^rw230489908hl

>Monthly Website Traffic
When a company’s website starts receiving high volumes of requests, it is easily a sign that the marketing department has struck gold with content. The inverse speaks volumes and suggests that something needs to change. Because it uses a monthly timeframe, this KPI is a quick test result for every campaign that leads back to a website. High traffic volume to a website is usually the starting point for good trends in other KPI examples. Even new monthly leads are directly proportional to the amount of traffic a website gets. ^rw230490040hl

>Engagement is a metric that shows how much communication a campaign gets from its target audience. Typical kinds of engagements or actions measured here would be the number of likes, follows, or shares a post gets once it goes live on a social media platform. The engagement rate measures the number of actions that take place over a specified period of time. Good engagement rates can indicate that you posted a potentially viral piece of content. For example, the more shares and likes a video gets in a short time period, the more the audience likely enjoys the content. ^rw230490094hl
