>how do you decide what’s a good subject for a tech cartoon?
Let’s take this comic on floating point I made last year! For that one, the steps were
>Remember that I was really confused about floating key point until I learned a few key insights from Stefan Karpinksi. When I learned these things my mind was totally blown and it was so exciting!!!
a double is 64 bits. That means there are only 2^64 floating point numbers!!!
The smallest double after 2^52 is 2^52 + 1 (so 2^52 + 0.2 = 2^52).
This means you can’t have integers above 2^53 in Javascript
Think “well, those three things are really simple, I could put them in a comic”
Figure out how to organize them into panels of a comic!!
Don’t draw more than one page. ^rw140405696hl

>drawings don’t have to be beautiful to be awesome
I started out by drawing things on paper with a pen / Sharpie and just taking pictures. They all looked way less good than everything I’ve posted above, but they were still really cool!! ^rw140405653hl

>You have a blank sheet of paper in front you, and some information you want to convey! How do you do it? Having a few structure patterns really helps. ^rw140405428hl

Comment: Very cool examples of lists. Need to come back here for review ^rw140405428comment

>I think panels are a popular way of structuring comics for a reason, they help split up your drawing and make it clear what order the comic should be read in. ^rw140405341hl

>At the beginning I said “I can’t draw well”, which is true! But I can trace things. It’s a fun way to make up for my lack of drawing skills ^rw140404931hl

Comment: When you get to a logo, don't just paste it in. Trace over it to make it feel less polished. Similar to what an interviewee said about polished videos ^rw140404931comment

>you can make a list of steps (step 1! step 2! step 3!)
it’s a really clear structure and so they’re easy to understand
it’s a nice way to teach someone something new (maybe you list 10 interesting things, and they only knew about 7 of them!)
none of them claim to be exhaustive (I didn’t say those were all the attributes of a process!)
sometimes I learn surprising things while making them. For example I started listing Linux networking tools and I was really surprised by how many of them there were (I ended up listing 24 of them!) (here’s the whole list) ^rw140404498hl
