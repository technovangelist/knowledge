>Whatever you do, please don’t buy a VacuVin or anything resembling such a device that allows you to “pump out the air from the bottle.” These devices just don’t work as advertised. Sure, they remove some air, but not enough to truly protect the wine. I’ve done various trials at home and in my experience, wines sealed with VacuVin last no longer than wines with the cork pushed a little ways back in the bottle ^rw140395029hl

>TL;DR: put the cork back in the bottle, and put it in the fridge. I find that most white wines will last up to a week or more in the fridge. Red wines with higher acidity will last 4 to 7 days before they start to taste funky to me, and sparkling wines closed with a proper sparkling wine stopper will last a week or more depending on how much wine is left in the bottle. ^rw140394778hl
