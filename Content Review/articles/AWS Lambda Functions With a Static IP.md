>AWS Lambda supports executing your code from inside a VPC. With this ability weâ€™re able to create a NAT (Network Address Translator) Gateway so that all out-bound connections from our lambda functions will exit from the NAT which is assigned to a fixed IP address. This fixed IP adress can then be whitelisted by our third-parties
>Create a new VPC to run your code in (or use an existing VPC)
Create a new Internet Gateway to communicate with the Internet from inside your VPC
Create a Public Subnet and add a new route to the route table which routes to your Internet Gateway from 0.0.0.0/0
Create a new Elastic IP address.
Create a new NAT Gateway and assign it to the Public Subnet and Elastic IP address that you just created.
Create a Private Subnet and add a new route to the route table which routes to your NAT Gateway from 0.0.0.0/0 ^rw43203496hl
