>A big mountain is tough to climb. It gets exponentially harder the closer you get to the top as oxygen levels decrease, wind increases, temperature drops, and willpower depletes. That’s why you want to structure your project into hills that deliver value every step of the way: day-time hikes with picnic baskets. Sometimes, the inevitable mountain appears–and that’s okay, but be realistic about what it means to the project. ^rw43507557hl

>When you’re cleaning your house, you do this one messy place at a time: the bedroom closet, then the attic, and lastly, the dreaded basement. Doing it all at once would be utter mayhem; ^rw43507555hl

>With the teams I work with, we operate with the idea of peak complexity: the time at which a project reaches its highest complexity. Peak complexity has proved a useful mental model to us for reasoning about complexity. It helps inform decisions about when to step back and refactor, how many people should be working on the project at a given point in time, and how we should structure the project. ^rw43507553hl
