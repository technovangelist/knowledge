>Before SLICK, SLOs and other performance metrics were stored in custom dashboards, documents, or other tools. If you wanted to locate a team’s SLOs, it could take an hour of searching or asking people to find something. ^rw263989674hl

>When a large-scale incident happens, service owners can evaluate side-by-side how it affected overall user experience. They can do so by looking at SLOs in our on-call tooling. On the flip side, we can also use SLOs to drive the process of declaring when a large incident has occurred. We initiate this by using SLOs as criteria for incidents within the company. Many of our systems use these criteria to get alerted about problems that their users see. ^rw263990056hl
