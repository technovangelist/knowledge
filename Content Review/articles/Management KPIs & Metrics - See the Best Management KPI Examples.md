>CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST
How much does it cost you to sign up a customer?
The CAC or Customer Acquisition Cost is a crucial management KPI for your business, both for your company and for investors. It represents all the costs incurred to convince a prospect to buy a product or service, and thus turn him into a customer. ^rw230490449hl

>CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE (CLV)
How much money will you get from a customer over the course of your relationship?
The CLV is a prediction of all the value that will derive from doing business with a customer. The problem is we never know how long a relationship will be, so it is better to make a good estimate and state the CLV as a periodic value: this customerâ€™s 6, 12 or 24 months CLV is of that amount. To calculate this sales related management metric, you need to distract the CAC of the total amount of revenue you expect from that customer over that period of time. The CLV also lets you know how much money you can allow for your CAC to still be profitable. This is a metric important to track: the longer you manage to keep customers paying, the more revenue you will make. ^rw230490730hl
