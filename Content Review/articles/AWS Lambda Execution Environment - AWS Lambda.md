>Shutdown: This phase is triggered if the Lambda function does not receive any invocations for a period of time. In the Shutdown phase, Lambda terminates the runtime, alerts the extensions to let them stop cleanly, and then removes the environment. Lambda sends a Shutdown event to each extension, which tells the extension that the environment is about to be shut down. ^rw136367530hl

>Init: In this phase, Lambda creates or unfreezes an execution environment with the configured resources, downloads the code for the function and all layers, initializes any extensions, initializes the runtime, and then runs the functionâ€™s initialization code (the code outside the main handler). The Init phase happens either during the first invocation, or in advance of function invocations if you have enabled provisioned concurrency. ^rw136367490hl
