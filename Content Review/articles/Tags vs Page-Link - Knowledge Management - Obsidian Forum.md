>Great topic! I imagine everyone does something different . Personally, I like to use tags for static identifiers like note types (person, book, article, daily journal, weekly review) or status (not started, in progress, final draft, done). Everything else is a note/link. I realized that when I was using tags for categories that I almost always wanted to add some information with the tag so it needed to be a note. ^rw143085429hl
