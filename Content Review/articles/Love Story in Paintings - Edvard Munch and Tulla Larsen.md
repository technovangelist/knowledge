Comment: asgardstrand and asgard as in location of the gods and the superior race in Startgate Atlantis have different accents over the letters... those little circles. ^rw152754499comment

>Just a year after their meeting, Munch wrote to his beloved: &quot;During the time we have been together — in all of the moments — when we lay close to each other — when we viewed the magnificent wonders of Florence — when we walked together along a sunlit road — when we sat together — and even in the moments that should have been the most intensely happy — even then happiness shone on me merely as through a door ajar — a door that divided my dark cell from the brightly lit ballroom of life itself.&quot; Far from the most romantic love confession, to be honest. ^rw152758462hl

>Surprisingly, the trip was really fast — and in early September, he returned to Norway. Tulla came to his house. Almost nothing is known about what happened next except that while in the same room with Tulla, Munch got a gunshot wound to a finger on his left hand. It might be that he tried to commit suicide, but dared only to injure himself, or Tulla wanted to shoot him (or herself), and he tried to stop her. It’s either Tulla kicked up a fuss, or Edward failed to keep himself in check. They say, in addition to the gun and two desperate lovers, a significant role in this incident was played by a couple of bottles of brandy, almost empty at the time of the shot. ^rw152758819hl

>A year later, Tulla married the artist Arne Kavli, who was 10 years younger than her, and who painted tender, touching portraits of his wife. Seven years later they divorced, but she got married again the same year — and lived with her second husband for 10 years. That’s all we know about Tulla’s life: after the break with Munch, the secular chronicles and art historians were no longer interested in her. ^rw152758820hl
