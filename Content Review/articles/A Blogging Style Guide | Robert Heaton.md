>Don't bury the lede. You're not writing a thriller, and you should rarely build towards a big reveal that the reader realizes they should have seen coming all along. Prefer to instead state a conclusion, then demonstrate why it is true. ^rw41448998hl

>easy and requires almost no work.
If you need a quick name for a generic fictional character, consider using one from a culture or gender that you usually wouldn't.

Comment: I think this is a problem I tend to have. I usually start with why i wrote something and don't think of starting with why they should read it. ^rw41448986comment
