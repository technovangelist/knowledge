>Finally, don’t forget that your organization has its own story – its founding myth. An effective way to communicate transcendent purpose is by sharing that tale. What passion led the founder(s) to risk health and wealth to start the enterprise? Why was it so important, and what barriers had to be overcome? These are the stories that, repeated over and over, stay core to the organization’s DNA. They provide guidance for daily decision-making as well as the motivation that comes with the conviction that the organization’s work must go on, and needs everyone’s full engagement to make a difference in people’s lives ^rw137383329hl

>Many of us know from Joseph Campbell’s work that enduring stories tend to share a dramatic arc in which a character struggles and eventually finds heretofore unknown abilities and uses these to triumph over adversity; my work shows that the brain is highly attracted to this story style. ^rw137383303hl

>my experiments show that character-driven stories with emotional content result in a better understanding of the key points a speaker wishes to make and enable better recall of these points weeks later. ^rw137382924hl

Comment: hearing a story with emotional content that grabs me, means that I am more likely to remember the content of the story.  begin every preso with a human scale story. ^rw137382924comment

>In subsequent studies we have been able to deepen our understanding of why stories motivate voluntary cooperation ^rw137382598hl

Comment: a story must first sustain attention by developing tension. If it grabs the user, then they will share the emotions of the characters and continue to mimick their feelings ^rw137382598comment

>we found that character-driven stories do consistently cause oxytocin synthesis ^rw137381470hl

Comment: The study looked at if a story told in a video would be as effective as in person. Effectiveness was measured by levels of oxytocin in the blood, which has been shown to motivate cooperation with others. It enhances empathy. ^rw137381470comment

>Oxytocin is produced when we are trusted or shown a kindness, and it motivates cooperation with others. It does this by enhancing the sense of empathy, our ability to experience others’ emotions. Empathy is important for social creatures because it allows us to understand how others are likely to react to a situation, including those with whom we work. ^rw137378822hl
