>I did some tests,” he told Dean, according to Operación Lightfire. “We need a very powerful flash to be able to capture the details in the dark. The problem is that the flash takes too long to charge. I managed to adapt the flash to 12V batteries. The camera can shoot every 30 seconds.” ^rw137481473hl

>At the time, the Soviet Union closely guarded its rocketry and the Americans couldn’t work out why their technology was proving so much more successful. “We didn’t know exactly what fuel they were using. We didn’t even know the type of rocket,” he says. “It wasn’t so much the spacecraft itself, it was the rocket the CIA was interested in.” ^rw137478516hl

Comment: Although the race to the moon was the outward reason for their interest, national defense was the real reason. Lunik used tthe same rocket used on missiles aimed at the US. If they could figure out the rockets, they could come up with a better defence against nuclear attack ^rw137478516comment

>“We can delay it a few hours,” said Zambernardi, but he dissuaded Dean from staging a Mexican great train robbery, according to Operación Lightfire. “Moving photos are always very blurry,” Zambernardi told him. “We need the train to stop.” ^rw137477761hl

Comment: Zambernardi and Dean thought about intercepting the Lunik while it was on the train, but it probably wouldn't work ^rw137477761comment

They made treasonous Americans “disappear,” according to Mexican journalist and TV personality Jaime Maussan, who interviewed Zambernardi for a 2017 book about the mission, Operación LightFire. ^rw137477272hl

Comment: an expert in womanizing?? ^rw137476733comment

Comment: Silvetti essentially got permission from the president's chief of staff. I wonder if he knew that the president was a CIA informant? ^rw137476225comment

>Then the CIA learned that on November 21 the Soviet exhibition was headed to the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City. An intercepted shipping manifest described “models of astronomic apparatus.” The dimensions of the crate matched the Luna rocket: 17 feet long and 8 feet wide. Jackpot. The CIA just needed several hours alone to disassemble, photograph, scrape the rocket for remnants of liquid fuel, and inspect the parts for factory markings that could give them intelligence on Soviet operations. ^rw137471996hl

Comment: Interesting that the CIA would run the operation. I would think they would need ... hmm, did NASA exist yet? or a precursor of it? ^rw137471996comment

>Seven rockets had failed, misfired, or tumbled into the Pacific ocean without even reaching orbit: meanwhile a Soviet astronaut was already in training to walk on the moon. The Luna spacecraft contained the secrets to the Soviet’s success, and, Scott said, there was an opportunity on the horizon to steal them. ^rw137469753hl

Comment: The Americans couldn't build a satellite, but if they could steal it from the Russians, they could leapfrog them and get into space. ^rw137469753comment

Comment: The effort to launch America's own satellite cost 110 million dollars (nearly 1 billion today) and it didn't work. ^rw137468135comment

>Weeks earlier, on October 4 of 1959, a pillar of fire lit up the sky above the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, a remote Soviet space facility. That night, a Soviet Luna 8K72 rocket roared into the sky trailing a plume of white exhaust. As it reached the edge of the atmosphere and shed its booster rockets, the cone-shaped upper stage opened like a Russian doll, giving birth to a smaller space probe: Luna 3. The craft was the size of a large garbage can, and possibly the most sophisticated machine ever sent into space. Its four insect-like antennae received radio signals from the Soviets, who guided it on a journey to see what no human had ever set eyes on—the far side of the moon. ^rw137463971hl
