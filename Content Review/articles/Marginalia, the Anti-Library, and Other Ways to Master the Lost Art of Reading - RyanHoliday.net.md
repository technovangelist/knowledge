>Quit books that don’t hold your interest or deliver the goods. Swarm onto topics that do, even if there is no immediate relevancy to what you’re doing. ^rw132623647hl

Comment: its ok to not like a book. don't waste any more time on it. but when you find a topic that is interesting, get into it more. find other books on thtat topic and make new connections ^rw132623647comment

take notes. find the quotes you like and use a system to store it. write down what you think of what you are reading. writing helps you process and have a collection of stories you can use in daily life ^rw132623646comment

>It’s not something you do because you feel like it, but because it’s a reflex, a default. Like breathing. Like drinking. ^rw132623644hl

Comment: Reading is important. Make sure you buy books you want to learn from. Spending $1000 / year on books is fine. Add things to your purchase list, then get them. Maybe not on Amazon, but get them from your favorite local bookstore. ^rw132623644comment
