Don&amp;apos;t give hackers more tools to expand their exploits
&gt;Layer Housekeeping
Understand how layers work at build and run-time
&gt;Build strategies
Multi-Stage, repeatable builds, standardized labeling, alternative tools

># Don&amp;apos;t run as root
You probably don&amp;apos;t need it
&gt;Privileged Containers
You almost definitely don&amp;apos;t need it
&gt;Drop capabilities
Most apps don&amp;apos;t need even Linux capabilities;
dropping all and allow only what&amp;apos;s needed
&gt;Read Only Root Filesystem
Immutability makes exploiting your container harder
&gt;Deploy from known sources
Pull from known registries only. ^rw263631725hl
