Comment: The contact tracing app used in the UK may have prevented about 600k cases of Covid 19. the average person who got covid sent 4.4 notifications to others to let them know to get tested. But this could probably only work in countries like the UK where there is a central health authority. The US has different databases in different states and municipalities and unless Biden takes steps to unite them, it will be hard to recreate beyond the state level. And unifying those datasets means potential privacy concerns to deal with. A tough problem. ^rw144371446comment
