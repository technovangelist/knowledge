>Worry that your attempts to gain sway are manipulative. You’re being strategic
>Slouch as you talk. Standing up straight with your shoulders back helps you come across as confident and commanding

>Clark recommends creating a “power map” to guide your campaign. “Create an org chart of decision makers related to your issue,” she says. As you go through the levels, “ask yourself, ‘Can I influence this person directly? If not, whom can I influence who can influence that person?’” Then begin to think about how and when you will approach these various colleagues. “War-game the situation,” she says. “Who might be threatened by your plans, and how can you bring them over to your side?” You’re not scheming; you’re strategizing. ^rw122380865hl

Comment: wow, i have never done anything strategically like this. cool idea. ^rw122380865comment

Comment: even if you think body language is bogus and can think of many places where it isn't accurate, enough others believe it (just like the bogus idea of learning styles) ^rw122380863comment

>“It’s never been harder to influence others, because they’ve never been more distracted,” he says. “Information overload and the pace of our digital lives have [led to short attention spans].” And yet, “it’s more important than ever to be able to command influence, because of the increased pressure on getting results.” ^rw122380860hl
