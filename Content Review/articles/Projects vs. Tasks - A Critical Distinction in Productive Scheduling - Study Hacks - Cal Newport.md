Comment: Cal has some projects that never work their way into specific tasks. They are placed on a quarterly plan. Some weeks they get put on the weekly plan and then maybe to time spent during a day ^rw136362847comment

>David Allen asked ‘Is it actionable?’; separating tasks from ideas ^rw136362846hl

Comment: What is a task. Some tasks are easy to define. a concrete task calling a contact is straightforward. Others are hard to define. Summarize War and Peace is the example and that is vague. I think the problem there is that the user is lazy and hasn't defined a granular enough task ^rw136362846comment

#### Extras:
The [podcasts](/knowledge/Content Review/podcasts) turned out to be a bit of a waste of time. Too much of 'you need to use this tool to be productive'
