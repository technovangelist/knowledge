>By taking the time and making the effort to rephrase the content you are consuming, you are more likely to commit the information to your long-term memory. ^rw132623636hl

>Note-taking is fast, uses the original author’s language, and generally feels easier. The issue is the content is often poorly assimilated and easily forgotten. In contrast, note-making is slower, more involved, and uses our own language. As a result, the content is easier to understand and remember. ^rw132623635hl

Comment: note take vs note making. you are going to remember more if you take notes in your own words. summarize the key points rather than just outlining what the source said. ^rw132623635comment
