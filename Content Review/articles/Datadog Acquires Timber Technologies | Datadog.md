>“Observability has become central to how businesses operate in the modern digital world, yet organizations have little to no control over what data is collected and managed by multiple observability platforms, creating complex compliance issues, vendor lock-in and cost overruns,” said Renaud Boutet, Vice President, Product, Datadog. “With Datadog’s ‘Without Limits’ model we introduced some choices for customers for how to manage their observability data in the cloud. And, with Vector, we plan to bring this flexibility to on-premises environments while also adding many new features.” ^rw144393487hl
