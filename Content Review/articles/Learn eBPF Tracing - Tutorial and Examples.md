>eBPF did not make this possible â€“ I can rewrite tcplife to use older kernel technologies. But if I did, we'd never run such a tool in production due to the performance overhead, security issues, or both. What eBPF did was make this tool practical: it is efficient and secure. For example, it does not trace every packet like older techniques, which can add too much performance overhead. Instead, it only traces TCP session events, which are much less frequent. This makes the overhead so low we can run this tool in production, 24x7. ^rw136582121hl

Comment: since this is triggered on tcp session events and not every packet, its more efficient, more secure, and has all the info the user actually needs. ^rw136582121comment

Comment: rather than writing a program with direct knowledge of ebpf, you write it using a framework, like bcc or bpftrace. This simplifies things. ^rw136581948comment

>eBPF does to Linux what JavaScript does to HTML. (Sort of.) ^rw136581339hl

Comment: with ebpf, you can write a program that runs in a vm in the kernel rather than direct in the kernel. this vm has access to all of the networking features, but now your programs don't need to recompile the kernel ^rw136581339comment
