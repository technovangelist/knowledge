>Business metrics in Datadog provide transaction-level insight, revealing issues that threaten revenue or customer satisfaction. Customer-impacting problems may stem from the application itself or from the underlying IT infrastructure, so engineers need data from all the systems that support business transactions in order to troubleshoot effectively. Datadog provides business metrics, application performance monitoring, infrastructure metrics, real user monitoring, and more in one tightly integrated platform. Regardless of the source, Datadog unifies all this data by applying a common tagging structure, enabling engineers to pivot seamlessly between correlated data to resolve business-impacting issues as quickly as possible. ^rw230486076hl
