&gt;Speaker 0: That&#39;s Ron White. He&#39;s a memory expert with courses, seminars and a YouTube channel on how to improve your memory, which is good news. If, like me, you&#39;ve ever met someone at a party and for gotten their name in the middle of talking to them, it&#39;s

>Speaker 0: for leaders at every stage from student to CEO. And we know that people learn in different ways. Some learn through ideas, and the more concrete we make the ideas, the more it&#39;ll stick. Most people learn best through human stories, and the more visual or sensory we make the stories, the more they&#39;ll stick. Like Ron White, the memory expert pointed out, the mind remembers what it sees. So all this, the music, the metaphors, me talking to you right now, it&#39;s all the way to frame the content so you can use it in your own life. But be honest. It kind of helps to know that, right. It helps to know right at the beginning, what to expect so you can feel smart instead of stupid ^rw152990554hl
