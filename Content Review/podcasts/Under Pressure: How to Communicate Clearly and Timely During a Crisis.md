Comment: There are crisis that cannot be planned for. Stanford u won’t be blamed if there is an earthquake but will be blamed if they don’t have a plan for it since they are in an earthquake zone. When planning for crisis think of all the worst case scenarios and plan the response ahead of time. ^rw135328820comment
