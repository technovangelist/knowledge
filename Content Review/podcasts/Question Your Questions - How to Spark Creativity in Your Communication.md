>me. Are you up for that? Your excellent. Alright, Well, question number one If you were to capture the best communication advice you've ever received as a 5 to 7 word presentation slide title, what would that be? Wow, that's so interesting. I'm gonna harken back to what we talked about before on I would say no. Your first and last words when you are giving a talk, you should know where you're starting and nail it and have that opening line of the opening story completely set And you should know the last works. You end up really engaging people in a way that they know where you are. They know where you're going ^rw140596836hl

>build a community that really supportive and trusting and works really well together. And my favorite lesson is that there is a huge benefit in seeing problems as opportunities on with that mindset, the world is opportunity rich. It's full of possibility. Essentially, entrepreneurs are ultimately optimists who are able to see and seize opportunities that others don't immediately see. In fact, if you come to our office at the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, you'll see painted on the walls and very big letters. Every problem is an opportunity. The bigger the problem, the bigger the opportunity on another wallet says entrepreneurs do much more than imaginable. With much lessons is possible, and these are the mindsets.

>a mindset of resilience and and bouncing back. Another one is in the end. All you have is your reputation. If others don't trust you, if they don't find you to be authentic, then it's gonna be really difficult to bring your ideas to life. You need to make sure that you spend time thinking about your values and make sure that you uphold them so that you could build a community that really supportive and trusting and works really well together.

>that you've gleaned over the years that you could share with us that we could benefit from? Oh, sure, there's so many. When that comes to mind is that failure is a normal part of the, uh, pro journey, and that if you're doing something that's really innovative really hard, that no one's done before, they're bound to be false starts and the steps. So you need to be prepared for setbacks, and you need to think of failure as an opportunity to redirect your energy and attention. And that's really important is having a mindset of resilience and and bouncing back. Another one is in the end. All you have is your reputation.

>yet virtually weaken. Do it. So taking time to embrace what this environment can allow us to do, I think, is also very important. I couldn't agree more. There's some things that actually worked much better online than they do in person. Of course, there's some things that have been, you know, sacrifice. But to look at the things that work well, as opposed to things that don't absolutely, you know, you have had amazing opportunities to interview and work with lots of entrepreneurs. Do you have any key insights or takeaways that you've gleaned over the years that you could share with us that we could benefit from? Oh, sure, there's so many.

>so there's just a fun way of getting everyone in the space and you sort of set the stage. The fact that you're together, you've all had listened to the same music. You have the same background and you're now ready to dive in. Also, I think it's really important to change up activities really quickly. Like every 10 to 15 minutes. I almost feel it's almost like Sesame Street. Yeah, every 10 or 15 minutes you need to change your watching a video to doing an activity Thio breaking into small groups. You know, folks get bored looking at the screen if things are static, so you need to plan a lot in advance. I view myself. It's more of a producer when I'm planning and online class. There's a tremendous amount of thought that goes into essentially ^rw139950593hl

>now moving into the classroom and then we turn off the music. We start three. Other thing is I often have the students. We all decide where we're gonna go. Okay. This week we're gonna meet in Antarctica. Everybody changes their backdrop to a picture from Andhra. But we're gonna go to New Zealand. And so there's just a fun way of getting everyone in the space and you sort of set the stage. The fact that you're together, you've all had listened to the same music.

>out my down jacket or, Gosh, I really wish I had hiking boots, and I print them out at the end of your trip. You kind of melt them back down. They go back up in the cloud. Or maybe there's Airbnb for close, right? You go somewhere and you rent all your clothes and then you give them back. Or maybe your suitcase. Maybe you have one suitcase that travels around the world independent of you, and you just go online and saying, suitcase, go to Paris. Okay, what's wrong when it tells you so that the fact is that you need to question the questions you ask. And this is one of most powerful things you could do toe unlock, really, really innovative solutions. Well, first, I'd love to live in that reality because I hate slipping suitcases.

>And then she'd say, And my name is so and so And this is what I'm excited about. And this is what I'm studying that's gonna help me get there. And so we now do that in all the introductions. The students all have to start out with what they're passionate about. Imagine a world where on then they have to start with that before they tell anyone who they are or what they're studying. I love that I love that, and it dovetails nicely with what I teach, which is start like you're in action movie all action movie. Start with action and then you learn the title of the movie and the credits and what you're doing in those introductions is the same thing. Start by getting people passionate, engaged, and then you can introduce yourself. I love it. I love it.

>those ideas that are really compelling, like I really liked leveraging the story spine. In that way, I use the story. Spine is an example of the power of structure in communication in general. And what's so cool about this story, spine is that it really invites that creativity from the get go, and it requires you to really stay focused on your audience in there needs. To my mind, one of the most important things of any storytelling is making sure that you engage the audience and make it relevant to them. And that approach that you take puts that at the forefront. So that's really powerful. Yeah, I I also one of the other things I think is extremely important is to think about the hook at the beginning of the story, and there's so many ways toe have a great hook. It could be a really surprising ^rw139949161hl

>since then now it sounds really, really simple, but it's actually quite difficult to do. And so I give my students. I'll give them an opening prompt, like there once was a girl who dreamed of flying. Or it could be some problem. Like, you know, there are 500 million people in the world who suffer from some ailment, and I set the stage for a problem and then have them tell a story. It's really amazing to see them start mastering these skills that allow them to then communicate the ideas they come up with class, the ideas that come up with in class to really share those ideas that are really compelling, like I really liked leveraging the story spine.

>Are you familiar with that? I am. But why don't you share with others? Yeah. So the story spine is super simple. It it starts out like this once upon a time and every day. And of course, that sounds familiar, but essentially sets the stage for where you are now. You know, once about a time, and you describe the problem and the consequences. The problem, and then after that is until one day, and that is your intervention. That's what you're gonna do that's gonna change the plot. And after that it's because of that because of that. And because of that, because of that, you can have as many because of that sets essentially the consequences of your intervention, and it ends with, and ever since then, okay, and so it then paints a picture of the world after your intervention has ^rw139949105hl

>innovative approach to their communication? This is really, really important. I know that you think about this a lot when I'm going to tell you. Probably is something that you think about all the time. But my world opened up dramatically when I realized the power of storytelling. I saw people who are great communicators. But what I didn't realize is how they were using storytelling to really effectively get their message across. So at this point, I teach storytelling tools and techniques and the power of storytelling and almost every one of my classes.
