>Speaker 0: to talk about how we could improve n y times dot com He knew we were slow to accept that computer screens would replace print newspapers. He could have called us chimpanzees, but he followed that fundamental rule of writing and speaking with influence. Say what you like, what you would like, not what you don't like. So Steve started by saying what he liked. He told us that the nation needed The New York Times that he and his family were such avid readers that they would fight over the Sunday prints sections in their living room. We were so flattered map. We would have followed him off a cliff after that. ^rw142548169hl
