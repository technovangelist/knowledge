# Learn in Public

This section in my notes supports my **Learn in Public** stream. I am planing for this to happen every Tuesday at 1:30 PM US Pacific time (GMT -8??). This will probably be on YouTube and probably on my personal channel. 

The goal of "Learn in Public" is to 
1. publicly prepare for a video I am producing that week
2. review what was talked about last week
3. answer any questions about [Infra](/knowledge/LIP/What is Infra) (this section will be pretty light until folks know who we are)

- 2022-02-22 - [Authentication & Authorization](/knowledge/LIP/Authentication & Authorization)
- 2022-02-29 - TBD
