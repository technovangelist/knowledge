I really wanted to like this app. Task management with integration to a calendar. Shows your meetings and autoschedules tasks around it since it knows about durations of tasks. It has a Mac app and IOS. 

But:
- the Mac app wants to be great but lots of features just don't work
    - If you try to edit the repeating task settings it won't remember what you set so you have to do that on the mobile app
- If you create a task that needs to be done at 4 and then tell it to autoschedule it often puts it at 10am, even though you said it has to be 4
- If you create a task then tell it to repeat, then set the project, it will always ignore the project and bring it into your inbox. 
- There is no real concept of templates. This is my big annoyance with Todoist which claims to have templates, but its just about copying existing projects. 
- There is no API. One can get around the lack of real templates in [Todoist](Tools I Use/Todoist.md) using the API, but no such luck here.
