Note taking app I started using right after I made my video about taking notes with **OrgRoam**. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg61ocfxk3c)

Obsidian is pretty amazing since it has all the features of many far more expensive tools and runs locally. Just started using the publish feature so if you are seeing this, you are experiencing the publish feature. 

One of the newer features, transclusion, was the one feature Roam had that was missing. 


| Competing Tool | Why not use it                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Roam           | online only, aggressive leader, slow development, too expensive especially considering they have no new ideas                                     |
| OrgRoam        | extension of org mode in emacs. If you have accepted the pain of emacs, this is great. But for the rest of us its too painful                     |
| MindForge      | linux first and mac not really supported for a lot of things. Been around for a long time and expects you to have gotten used to it in that time. |
