This is my main task management tool. There are things I don't like about it, but there is nothing that is as powerful in most ways. I wish I didn't have to pay $35 per year to use it, but oh well. 

Perhaps my biggest issue with it is a lack of any real template support. They recognize this, have a kludgey workaround, but haven't fixed it in the few years I have mentioned it to them. 

I considered [Sorted3 for Macj](/knowledge/Not Using or Evaluating/Sorted3 for Macj) but the lack of API and a very buggy mac app means I can't really rely on it.
