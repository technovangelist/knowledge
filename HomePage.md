This is my public mind. Just a collection of notes that aren't completely private. I just started exploring this public version of my notes and will gradually migrate stuff i wrote for a non-public audience.

The **Content Review** folder includes all the notes from books, articles, podcasts, and videos I have reviewed. There isn't a lot of analysis here, just raw notes. The workflow for taking these notes is here: [workflow for processing notes](workflow for processing notes.md). Still figuring this stuff out. 

**Not Using or Evaluating** is about the tools that I have decided to not use anymore, or just tools I am trying to figure out how they could be useful.

**Tools I Use** are some of the, umm, tools I use. This is mostly a reminder to me about why I find them useful. 

Then everything else is stuff that doesn't go anywhere yet. 

I wrote everything above this a year ago. I still haven't really figured this stuff out. 

Another section is [LIP](LIP.md): Learn in Public. The notes I will put together in a weekly stream revolving around my employer, [InfraHQ](LIP/What is Infra.md).
